NewsThe security forces have been able to record a radio message that was sent to LTTE battlefield commanders in Kilinochchi by their Supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran, threatening them never to face him again after they allowed Kilinochchi to fall. 



 This message clearly reveals the manner in which LTTE field commander Swarnam is stringently criticised by the LTTE Leader about the defeat in Kilinochchi. The commanders had informed Prabhakaran that they have no other option other than to withdraw their troops from the battlefields, even thought Prabhakaran had ordered them to continue the battle and not give up Kilinochchi. This decision of the armed leaders who were at the battlefront in Kilinochchi had enraged the LTTE Leader and had sent this radio message to them. 



 Until this incident, Prabhakaran had not given direct orders regarding any of the battles during the fourth Eelam war. A security forces official remarked that this action of LTTE Leader Prabhakaran clearly explains the downfall of the LTTE. 



 The official also added that after the death of former LTTE Political-wing Leader S.P. Thamilchelvan, Prabhakaran had never given direct orders through communication equipment, until January 2. 



 He said that Prabhakaran was careful not to send any radio messages because he feared that the security forces might be able to track his location through these messages. (LP)
