Traditional crafts are unique to Sri Lankan culture

The National Crafts Council has planned to offer national honours to traditional handicraftsmen. This is a result of a discussion had with the President and this program will be implemented from 2010 under the Rural Industries and Self-employment Promotion Ministry.

According to National Crafts Council Chairman Buddhi Keerthisena those national honours will be given to the master craftsmen above 50 years and it will be known as the 'Vishwa Karma' award. Traditional crafts are unique to Sri Lankan culture. Sri Lankan craftsmen have done immense service to preserve and develop our crafts. During the last 30 years of war environment our craftsmen have faced various hardships, but they have sacrificed their life to preserve their traditions.

To honour their services and skills, this program will be implemented according to the Chairman National Crafts Council. Accordingly those who have sacrificed their lives to create master craft and the best craftsmen will be given this 'Viswa Karma' award. In addition to this award they will be given free insurance policy and cash prizes.
