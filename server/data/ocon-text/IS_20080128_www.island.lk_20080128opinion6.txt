I was shocked to find the increased or rather revised revenue licence fees from 2008-01-01 in newspapers recently. The other provincial councils will surely emulate the Western PC.

Now I will have to pay for my old car Rs. 1,200 per year and the present licence fee is only Rs. 350 annually. This is an increase of almost 400 per cent which is an unprecedented increase anywhere in the world.

Old people with very limited income from their pensions or savings use vehicles very sparingly in view of the increased prices of fuel, tyres, batteries, spare parts etc. What has happened to us is like a victim of a fall from a tree being gored by a bull as a saying goes.

I earnestly request the President to direct the Western Provincial Council to be reasonable without aggravating our predicament.
