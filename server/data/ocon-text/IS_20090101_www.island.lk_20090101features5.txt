A friend of mine recently received a memo from the "human resources department". It must be called that to distinguish it from his office, which is clearly the "sub-human resources department".

Anyway, these geniuses had noticed that his typical work-day now contained several activities not listed on their timesheets, which had not been updated since the Mesozoic Era (defined as "before Keith Richards' first wrinkle").

Mid-Morning Activities: 3162: Watching old video clips on YouTube; 3163: Waiting for suitable time to suggest another coffee break; 3164: Suggesting another coffee break; 3165: Drawing lots for a staff member to go to Starbucks to get lattes; 3166: Drinking latte while complaining about boss.

Late Morning Activities: 3167: Attending useless meeting; 3168: Finding posture in which to look attentive during meeting while catching up on sleep; 3169: Sleeping; 3170: Copying down list of personal "action items" from meeting; 3171: Throwing away list of personal action items on way out of meeting.

Lunch Hour Activities: 3182: Eating lunch while swapping malicious gossip about other staff; 3183: Going to the toilet; 3184: Sleeping in the toilet; 3185: Thinking about how awful life is; 3186: Planning ill-fated social event to make life better; 3187: Rewriting CV; 3188: Secretly faxing CV to other employers; 3189: Sneaking out of the office to see headhunter.

Early Afternoon Activities: 3190: Running your own business on company time; 3191: Complaining about opposite sex; 3192: Complaining about life; 3193: Complaining about pay; 3194: Writing sci-fi screenplay on company time; 3195: Staring into space, thinking about things; 3196: Staring into space.

Late Afternoon Activities: 3197: Pretending to work while boss is watching; 3198: Engaging in possibly illegal fantasies; 3199: Waiting for six o'clock; 3199: Tidying desk and preparing to leave as six o'clock approaches: 3200: Smiling for the first time that day as one leaves the office.

Okay, okay, I admit it. That's not really a new set of timesheet codes. It's how I spent yesterday. But don't look so smug. You probably did exactly the same, didn't you? Huh? Huh?
