An inquiry should be instituted to find out how the camera crews of the other TV channels were able to video the incident involving minister Mervin Silva at the Rupavahini Corporation last week, Colombo Municipal Council Member Lal Peiris told The Island yesterday (31).

He said Minister Silva had gone to the Rupavahini Corporation to discuss why the speech he made at Matara on the previous day was not telecast in the news bulletin of the Rupavahini channel. "No clash took place when he went there. I too did not go there to fight with anyone."

However, even the police could not bring order among the Rupavahini staff, Peiris said.

During the clash the Rupavahini Corporation staff took the law to their own hands. Police were not able to do their duty but they made a sincere effort to bring order to the place. Though the Rupavahini is a state media institution it has to be found out how the camera crews of the private media gained admission at the time of the clash, he said.

Rupavahini staff said the thugs including Lal Peiris should not have come into their institution. "If Lal Peiris came with bona fide intentions there was no reason for him to hide his face from the TV cameras."

Journalists said there was no harm in private media persons entering Rupavahini to report what was taking place. If they had not gone there the incident of the attack on the News Director of the Rupavahini TV channel may not have been reported to the public they said.
