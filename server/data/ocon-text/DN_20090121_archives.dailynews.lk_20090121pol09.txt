Of microphones and their use in Parliament

Speaker W.J.M. Lokubandara informed Parliament yesterday that he has instructed the Parliament officials to switch on the microphones of MPs only after they clearly announced their names.

"I have received a number of complaints from officials of Parliament on several harassments and influences faced by them," he said.

The Speaker was responding to questions raised by both Chief Opposition Whip Joseph Michael Perera and JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Both of them complained to the Speaker as Parliament officials have not properly provided microphones to Opposition MPs when they stand to present their ideas.
