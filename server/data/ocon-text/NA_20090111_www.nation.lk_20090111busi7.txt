BusinessEntry to Global Big League and significance to ComBank & SL  Managing Director of Commercial Bank, Amitha Gooneratne comments on the significance and of the Bank gaining entry into the Top 1000 Banks in the World in an exclusive interview 

Q: Entering to the Ranks of Top 1000 Banks in the world is no doubt a great achievement for any Bank. But how is this list complied.

 A: The Banker Magazine of London, which is almost considered a Bible for bankers, was founded in 1926, and has been ranking the Banks of the world based on different criteria such as Assets, Tier One Capital and Profits for the past 40 years. With the increasing focus on Capital Adequacy, as the most important criteria to assess the strength and stability of a bank, since 1968, "The Banker" rankings have been based on strength of Tier One Capital. Their rankings are based on published sources and also with the feed back received from the Audited Annual Reports of commercial banks and Rating Agencies. This is carried annually and a special issue of the Magazine is published annually. All this information is also available on their website www.thebanker.com as well.



 Q: What is the significance of this great achievement on the Commercial Bank?

 A: Entering the Top 1000 is very significant not only to the Bank, but to Sri Lanka as well, because this is the first time a Sri Lankan Bank has entered the Big League of Global Banks. A strong capital adequacy signifies that a bank has the ability to absorb any unforeseen losses which are not uncommon, given the highly leveraged business of banking. A strong capital buffer helps a bank to protect depositors' funds with any losses falling primarily on shareholders, insulating and protecting depositors. 

 As a Sri Lankan Bank with a great deal of exposure to, and dealings with other countries and major international banks, our entry to the Top 1000, offers a further re-assurance to our correspondents and counterparties. 



 Q: How important is this achievement to Commercial Bank customers ?

 A: This is of great importance to our customers, particularly at a time when banks all over the world are facing a credibility crisis. Our entry to the Top 1000 and even more so at the 155th position in terms of soundness, underscores the traditional strength and stability of Commercial Bank.

 This achievement has been built up over a long period where we have always upheld principles of good corporate governance and prudent policies on lending and operational matters, always keeping us one step ahead of our competitors.

 The main significance to customers is that they have the re-assurance of dealing with a Sri Lankan Bank that knows what is best for our country and the customers but yet ranked among the global giants in banking.



Q: What is the significance of this achievement to Sri Lanka as a country and Sri Lankans in general?

 A: The significance to Sri Lanka is mainly, that for the first time, a Sri Lankan Bank has entered global rankings of banks based on capital strengths. This is a matter of pride to Sri Lanka. Being in this position, we would be able to undertake lines of financial intermediary business which are open only to the larger and stronger banks. All Sri Lankans will benefit by having a local bank with international rankings coupled with banking skills and right technology that will be always accessible to them.



Q: What other accolades has Commercial Bank won recently to re-affirm its' stability ?

 A: We were ranked "The Best Bank in Sri Lanka" for the 10th consecutive time by Global Finance of New York, which we consider a very important achievement. And we are doing everything to continue the superior performance which earned us this accolade over the last 10 years.



 We were also recently selected as "The Bank of the Year Sri Lanka" for the 7th time based on the rankings of "The Banker" - London and by the Euromoney of London.



 In addition to these main awards, there have been many other awards which we have been receiving for our Excellence in many different areas of our activities. Some of these are: the SAFA Award for Best Annual Report & Accounts â€“ 2007 in the South Asian Region, and being among the Top 10 Companies of Sri Lanka, to name a few. 

 All these achievements only confirm our commitment to maintaining superior performance and doing everything in the best possible manner, always safeguarding the interests of all our stakeholders.
