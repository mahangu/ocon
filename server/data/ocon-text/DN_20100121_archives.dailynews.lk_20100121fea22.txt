Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti, and cook until al dente, or eight to 10 minutes. Drain, and rinse under cold water. Toss with 1/4 cup olive oil, cover and keep warm.

Place another 1/4 cup olive oil in a skillet, and heat over medium heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook just until golden, two to three minutes. Add the sardines, and cook one minute more. Stir in the bread crumbs and 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese. If necessary to give the mixture a crumbly texture, stir in the remaining 1/4 cup of olive oil. Stir in the parsley and pepper, and remove from heat. If desired, serve with additional Parmesan cheese.

Ingredients

* 3/4 cup chicken broth

* 1 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste

* 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper

* 1/8 teaspoon salt

* 1 clove garlic, minced

* 4 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves

* 3 tablespoons dry bread crumbs

* 2 teaspoons olive oil

* 2 cups fresh sliced mushrooms

Directions

In a medium bowl, combine the broth, tomato paste, ground black pepper, salt and garlic. Mix well and set aside.

Dredge the chicken in the bread crumbs, coating well. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Saute the chicken in the oil for two minutes per side, or until lightly browned.

Add the reserved broth mixture and the mushrooms to the skillet and bring to a boil. Then cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove chicken and set aside, covering to keep it warm.

Bring broth mixture to a boil and cook for four minutes, or until reduced to desired thickness. Spoon sauce over the chicken and serve.
