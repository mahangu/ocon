SB's grand plan in disarray - Keheliya

Indika Polkotuwa and Asela Kuruluwansa

S.B. Dissanayake's efforts to 'turn the tide' have boomeranged when over 6,000 UNPers in Kandy left the UNP and joined UPFA, Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare Minister, Keheliya Rambukwella said.

The Minister said a large number of UNPers including members of the Central Province Local Government institutions are to join the UPFA before the Provincial Council election.

The unprecedented exodus of 6,000 members from one political party is a significant event in the country's political history.

"UNP greats such as President Premadasa, Lalith Athulathmudali, Gamini Dissanayake and Premachandra were assassinated by the terrorists. "So those leaders wherever they are would certainly bless President Mahinda Rajapaksa for the defeat of Prabhakaran and his terrorist organisation."

"Had D.S. Senanayake been alive today he would have taken Ranil to task for his infamous Ceasefire Agreement with Prabhakran," the Minister said.
