The Oppositions Common Presidential Candidate,General (Rtd) Sarath Fonseka,said yesterday that some in government have described him as having "only 40 days in politics",but they have forgotten that President Rajapaksa had only 40 days in an army uniform.

Addressing around 500 State Media employees including those in the national print and electronic media,at his Rajakeeya Mawatha Office,he said that Mahinda Rajapaksa had got into an army uniform to act in a film,long before he became President,but that was for only 40 days.

"I have served the army with distinction for 40 years.President Rajapaksa has only 40 days in an army uniform.Our economy is in a pathetic state,despite President Rajapaksa's 40 years of political experience",he said. "When I become President on Janaury 26,corruption and waste will be eliminated and the economy developed.The fruits,will be distributed among the people and not between one family."

Fonseka, said that under the Rajapaksa regime, the media has been hounded and attacked,but all that will change on January 26.

"I will introduce a Parliamentary Act that ensures the security and safety of journalists",he said."Steps will also be taken to increase their salaries and provide them with facilities necessary to perform their duties in peace of mind."
