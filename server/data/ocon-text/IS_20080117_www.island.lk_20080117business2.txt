The Colombo stock market tumbled sharply yesterday with the All Share Price Index losing 50.56 points (2.08%) while Milanka lost 47.43 points (1.53%) on a turnover of Rs.157.2 million, up from Monday's Rs.101.4 million.

"Despite the sharp fall, there was still some foreign buying that was evident," Prashan Fernando of DFCC Stockbrokers noted.

Brokers said that many price stocks came down sharply but on very small quantities with Cargills losing Rs.54.50 on 700 shares while the Hotels Corporation lost Rs.22 on 1,800 shares.

Similarly Sunshine Holdings lost Rs.18 on 500 shares while Elpitiya Plantations and Kandy Hotels lost Rs.10 each on 700 shares and 200 shares.

Yesterday's big trade was Distilleries where over 0.5 million shares were done between Rs.92 and Rs.94.50 losing a rupee on the VWA to close at Rs.94.25.

The Finance, one of the counters that saw foreign interest, gained a rupee on the VWA on a trading range of Rs.59 to Rs.65 on over 0.4 million shares traded yesterday.

Brokers said that there was also foreign interest in the non-voting shares of Tokyo Cement where 0.8 million shares were traded between Rs.17.25 and Rs.17.50 gaining 25 cents on the VWA to close at Rs.17.25.

They expected the downtrend to continue in the absence of positive news on the peace front and said that yesterday's market fall was partly attributable to a bus being bombed in the Uva.

Lanka Tiles announced that its share will trade XD from January 30 and a dividend of Rs.1.50 per share will be paid on February 12.
