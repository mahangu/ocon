Bollywood Group "Rang Puhar" under the able leadership of Shubra Bharadwaj will be presenting a show not to be missed "Bollywood through the Ages" - a medley of traditional Bollywood numbers ranging from the past to present. The vibrant dances will showcase the changing trends in Costumes, Style, Sound and Look in the Hindi film industry over the past 50 years.

The one and a half hour Show will be presented in three acts and be a part of Dinner Dance Extravagance called " Xtra Premium Bollywood Nite 09" powered by Lanka IOC. It will be held at Upper Crystal Room at Hotel TAJ Samudra on 28th Jan 08 from 7.30pm onwards. For the balance period, D J Kapila will entertain the invitees on the dance floor with his lively Bollywood music. The invitation pass for Dinner Dance is modestly prized at Rs 3000 net per person which is a steal since it includes Show, Elaborate Indian Dinner, Wines and Chasers. Box plan has just opened at TAJ Samudra. US Ambassador Robert Blake and his wife Sofia Blake will be the chief guests at this event.

Official Spokesperson for Lanka IOC informed us that they want to be associated with this Show and create awareness for Xtra Premium Petrol which gives 15 kms to 20 kms extra on a full tank compare to other available products.

Net proceeds of this show will go towards supporting the under privilege childen of "Kusum Sevana". Organisers of the Show are leading Indian ladies settled in Colombo. When contacted, they informed that they didn't want their names mentioned. They said that they had received so much from this beautiful Country and wanted in their small way to give back something to it.
