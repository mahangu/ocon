Muzzamil didn't commit bribery offence - Wimal

He said Muzzamil before accepting the money, had informed Inspector General of Police Mahinda Balasuriya in writing four days before the incident that a bribe was offered to him.

Weerawansa addressing the UPFA press conference at the Mahaweli Centre said utmost secrecy had to be ensured to video and record the conversations of those offering the bribe so that they could be taken before the law.

Western Provincial Council Minister Udaya Gammanpila citing an example said Police Inspector John Kotelawala in the previous century had gone to the notorious gambling den of Naina disguised as a gambler to arrest gamblers. Muzzamil also deceived those trying to bribe him to cross over to the Opposition by pretending to agree to their unlawful proposal, he said.
