Minister predicts damage to planet if environment pollution continues

If global environment pollution continues at the present rate irreparable damage would be caused to the planet by 2020. The Copenhagen environmental talks had failed and the talks to be held in Mexico could also fail, Environment and Natural Resources Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.

At a press conference at his ministry, the Minister said countries should separate their priorities to implement long-term development programs that would not harm the environment rather than short term programs that could damage the environment.

"The Government had implemented infrastructure development programs but by next August we will publish our development program to go along with the climatic and weather conditions without environmental pollution and damage," he said.

The Minister calling for restrain in using plastics, polythene and PVC materials said these material were not being recycled.

Therefore instead of burning these material they should be recycled as burning such material would cause environmental damage with the harmful and toxic substances being added to the atmosphere, he said.
