The complete eradication of leprosy is possible if the patients are diagnosed and treated at the early stages, Deputy Director General Health Services Dr. P. G. Maheepala said at a seminar held recently, to mark International Leprosy Day, that falls on January 26. It was organised by the Health Education Bureau, Colombo.

The Hendala Leprosy Hospital, which is 300 years old, is considered one of the oldest hospitals in Asia. The second hospital was built in the Mantivu in Batticaloa and is now run by the Batticaloa Teaching Hospital.

There are 53 patients at the Hendala Hospital. Though they are cured, most of them are unable to go home due to various reasons, including not knowing their whereabouts, he said. They had been admitted when they were around 15 years old. Eevery possible step has been taken to make their lives comfortable, he said. The government has plans to convert the Hendala Hospital into a centre that looks after aged patients with chronic diseases.

With the introduction of multi-drug treatment in 1983, the patients were able to be completely cured and lead a normal life. "An aggressive social marketing campaign showed positive results and Sri Lanka was able to reach the elimination level set by the World Health Organization in 1995, becoming the second among Asian countries", Dr. Maheepla said. At present altogether 124 countries have reached elimination level.

Leprosy and the treatment service, which was concentrated in two centres were wide-spread thus enabling patients to seek treatment at the main hospitals. "These efforts paid off as the current prevalence rate has dropped to 9 per 100,000 population, he said.
