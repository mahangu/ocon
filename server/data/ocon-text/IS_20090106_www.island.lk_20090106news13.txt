The Island-NewsDisaster Relief Services Minister M. S. S. Ameer Ali dismissed claims by the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress high command that he had accepted membership in another party.

He told The Island yesterday, "Along with several others, I have frequently focused on the fact that the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress has lost its commanding role as the voice of the Muslim community and that we have fallen short of the high ideals of our late leader M.H.M. Ashraff."

But he was aware that the All Ceylon Muslim Congress has goals which are identical with those of the SLMC.

"Hence, when it was suggested that I should become the Chairman of the party, I saw no objection to the suggestion."

However, he said after the Delegates' Meeting of the ACMC, he was asked become a member of that party and to be a member, in terms of its constitution he should cease to be a member of the SLMC.

"Thereupon I informed the ACMC General Secretary that I cannot sever my connection with the SLMC which I hold near and dear to my heart. Hence, I did not apply for membership in the ACMC and did not accept the office of Chairman."

He said that dual membership is a concept known to SLMC although several have misgivings on this account. There were very prominent members at the very top of the SLMC leadership who hold membership in the United National Party, too.

The SLMC General Secretary has issued a press statement to the effect that membership in other parties should be viewed as a major issue. "Unlike others I hold membership solely in the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress," he said.
