An eminent jurist, Justice Fernando, who retired prematurely in 2005 after serving as the longest serving Judge on the Bench of the Supreme Court, hailed from a family of Judges.

His father was former Chief Justice H. N. G. Fernando. His grandfather, W. M. Fernando was also a Judge of the Supreme Court.

Born on February 27, 1941, Justice Mark Fernando was educated at St. Joseph's College Colombo and later at the University of Peradeniya. He took his oaths as an advocate of the Supreme Court in July 1963 and first worked in the Chambers of Queen's Counsel H. W. Jayawardene. Having shone as an advocate he was conferred Silks in January 1985. He was known to have been one of the lawyers who drafted the 1978 Constitution of President Junius Richard Jayewardene.

He was recognised for his stand on human rights and was responsible for delivering many judgements that upheld the rights of citizens in respect of the right to vote, the right to freedom of speech and the right to freedom against torture and arbitrary arrest and detention, during his distinguished career.

In 2005, Justice Fernando opted for premature retirement from the Supreme Court, two and half years before his term ended. He was then the longest serving Judge on the Bench.

A massive signature campaign was launched to persuade Justice Fernando to stay on to complete his term. Signatories covered a wide range of the political spectrum, lawyers and law students as well as the ecclesiastical heads of the Buddhist, Catholic, Anglican and Methodist denominations.

He leaves behind his wife Pam had three children, a daughter Tanya, and two sons Sohan and Suren.
