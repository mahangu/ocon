The Island-NewsDid LTTE's fighting tactics match those of Nazi's during World War-II? A spate of deep bunkers erected by the Tigers around their fallen citadel of Kilinochchi might suggest that.

Sri Lankan troops engaged in clearing out the town of booby traps, mines and explosives have come across a string of heavily-fortified bunkers outside all major governing buildings in the city.

But, unlike, the World War-II era, the Tiger bunkers instead of mud and cement were hidden behind manicured hedges and so heavily-fortified that they could withstand artillery shells and pounding of heavy air dropped bombs.

These teak wood bunkers, with modern electric trappings and at times even air-conditioning, dotted all round the LTTE's former administrative city.

It is with the intention of protecting the top LTTE brass that these military bunkers buried partly or fully underground have been given a posh look, a defence official said.

He said the LTTE's top brass probably conducted their meetings with foreign and other important dignitaries in such bunkers.

Bunkers were extensively used during the World War I and II and subsequently by the militia groups fighting the government in many parts of the world with Adolf Hitler wary of his safety having a penchant for living underground in such shelters. (PTI)
