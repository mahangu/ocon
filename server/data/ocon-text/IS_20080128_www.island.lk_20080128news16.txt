There were 187,850 internally displaced persons in Sri Lanka as at December 31, 2007, the Foreign Ministry has said.

Of them 31,843 are stilling living in welfare centres, while while 156,007 are said to be living with friends and relatives. However, numbers given for Killinochchi, Mullativu and the Southern part of Jaffna cannot be verified.

These data are contained in a recent publication by the Ministry of Resettlement and Disaster Relief Services, the Ministry of Nation Building and Development and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.

The Foreign Ministry has said in a media release: "The government is committed to settling back all IDPs in their original homes. In the Eastern Province alone, over 108,000 IDPs have already returned to their homes since March 2007, and only 38,178 persons are living in welfare centres or temporary accommodation or with friends and relatives. Most of them have been held back due to the need for the clearance of landmines, the release said.

The settlement of IDPs back in their homes has been a voluntary process and it has been undertaken according to international standards. This has been acknowledged by the international community including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the World Food Programme (WFP)."
