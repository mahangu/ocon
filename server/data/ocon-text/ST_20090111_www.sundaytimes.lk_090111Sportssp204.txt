Jeewantha cracks career best 234Colts right hand batsman Jeewantha Kulatunga cracked a career best knock of 234 in just 194 balls guiding his side to make a massive 448 against Ragama CC on day two of their Premier league Tier 'A' cricket encounter played at Braybrooke Place. Jeewantha lofts one over the boundary line. Pic by Ranjith Perera Jeewantha's knock comprised 28 boundaries and a dozen sixes. He was well supported by another career best knock of 147 by former St Joseph's and Sri Lanka youth player Roshen Silva with the pair putting on a record 353 runs for the fifth wicket before they were parted.



 They eclipsed the record partnership of 317 for the fifth wicket which was set by Arjuna Ranatunga and Hemantha Wickramaratne in the 1996/97 inter-club cricket season.

The opening day saw Colts end on 270 for 4. Apart from the duo's massive contribution the other batsmen failed to make any impression against the Ragama CC bowlers.
