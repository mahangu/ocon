An offence is an offence, hence the offender should be brought to justice. The culprits involved in the armed attack on "Sirasa" and the killing of journalist Lasantha Wickrematunge should be arrested without undue delay.

President Mahinda Rajapaksa has condemned these atrocities and has instructed the police to arrest the offenders involved in the afore-said heinous crimes. The Opposition Leader has stated, that the government should reveal the truth to the public.

It is an admitted fact, that president Rajapaksa has almost suppressed terrorism in Sri Lanka within a short period of three years. Whereas his predecessors have miserably failed to quell this menace even for twenty two years. Hence he is being credited for this incredible achievement. However many opposition members accuse the President and go all out to make capital out of this misfortune. I trust that the President with the help of the police will make those despicable scoundrels face justice, because it is his duty to maintain "Law and Order" in the country.
