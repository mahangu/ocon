Former JVP Kegalle District MP Anuruddha Polgampola joined forces with the ruling party yesterday pledging his and his supporters' allegiance to the President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the forthcoming Presidential Polls.

"JVP has betrayed its cadres' trust and is now dancing to the tune of international forces," Polgampola told The Island adding that a large number of cadres had left the party owing to the political marriage between the JVP and the UNP. He said the reactionary conspiracies had to be defeated and all progressive forces must join hands with President Rajapaksa.

Polgampola was expelled from the JVP on September 03, 2008 on disciplinary grounds after he was found guilty of a human smuggling attempt.

The vacancy created by Polgampola was filled by UPFA member Lalith Dissanayake who was sworn in as an MP on September 12, 2008.
