Part of the fund-raising proceeds from a Qatar Airways-sponsored international car rally last year have been donated to Doha-based Dhreima, the Qatar Orphan Foundation.

The Arabian Gulf Adventures Car Rally involving over 70 Rolls Royce and Bentley car enthusiasts in Doha, began in the Qatari capital and was the first tour of its kind ever held in the Middle East. Qatar Airways was the Official Airline of the event.
