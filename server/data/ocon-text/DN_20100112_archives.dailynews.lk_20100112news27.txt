The CID is to take into custody a group of suspects including a Kurunegala District Parliamentarian who are alleged to have forged a deed of a land to make it appear as if it is owned by Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. They have forged the documents in connivance with a real estate agent in Kurunegala.

Addressing the media yesterday at the Media Centre for National Security, Director General of MCNS Lakshman Hulugalla said Intelligence reports revealed that an MP from the Kurunegala District had produced a fake deed with the help of the real estate agent to make it appear that the said property belonged to the Defence Secretary.

"Following information, the Defence Secretary took a swift action and lodged a complaint with the CID. The culprits have been traced and suitable legal action will be taken", he added. He said that in the same manner there were many allegations that the Defence Secretary is possessing many properties.

The Defence Secretary is a respected Government servant. "All these allegations were orchestrated by certain elements to tarnish the image of the Defence Secretary", Hulugalle added. He said there are certain elements operating to divert the attention of public by acts of sabotage .

" They are damaging public property in order to put the blame on the Government and asking the Government to take the responsibility . For example, they remove parts of Fly Overs and say that the Government had not built it properly. They are the same people who were operating in 1986- 89 era. These people have formed an alliance and are creating mischief .

The public should be aware of the correct situation and be cautious. If the public observe any such sabotage they should immediately inform the nearby police station.
