We must stand united - Prime Minister

The Administrative and Financial Regulations governing public servants are not meant for doing no work at all, Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka said.

"They should be used for guidance to provide an efficient service to the public. I am always prepared to give political leadership to any employee who takes correct decision in the interest of the public," Prime Minister Wickramanayaka said.

The Prime Minister made these revelations while inaugurating the official functions of the Prime Minister's Office with the dawn of the New Year.

"It is Government's objective to make a self-sufficient and self-reliant Sri Lanka in a peaceful and ethical atmosphere," he said.

"Just as the way our people showed their unity when the tsunami struck Sri Lanka, it is also necessary for us to stand united in our task to make a self-sufficient Sri Lanka," the Prime Minister said.

"We must also look back at what we have done in the past.

"Last year, our Forces were able to eliminate the LTTE terrorism from this soil under the able leadership of the Government.

"We must also begin our activities for the new year with a sense of self-confidence.

"We have a duty to render an honest service to the masses," the Prime Minister said. Prime Minister's Secretary Mahinda Bandusena, Private Secretary Indika P. Chandrathilake, Additional Secretary S.S. Miyanawela, Coordinating Secretaries and top officials were also present.
