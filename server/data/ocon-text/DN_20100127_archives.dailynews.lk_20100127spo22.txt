Egypt stun Cameroon

Egypt kept their title defence firmly on track with a 3-1 extra time win over Cameroon while goalkeeper Victor Enyeama was Nigeria's penalty shoot-out hero against Zambia in Monday's quarter-final action at the Africa Cup of Nations.

Egypt now face bitter rivals Algeria and Nigeria take on Ghana in Thursday's semi-finals with the victors meeting in Luanda's 11 November stadium in Sunday's finale.

It was always going to be hard to live up to Algeria's thrilling five goal extra time win over favourites Ivory Coast on Monday, but silky smooth Egypt managed it.

The Pharoahs extended their unbeaten run in the continental championship to 17 games despite going a goal down with skipper Ahmed Hassan heading in to his own net.

But Hassan celebrated earning an African record 170th cap with a peach of a goal in the 37th minute, firing in from 35 yards to land the ball inches in front of keeper Carlos Kameni who watched in despair as the ball bounced past him.

Extra time was only two minutes old when substitute Mohamed 'Gedo' Nafy put Egypt in front and they turned the screw on 95 minutes when a curling freekick by Hassan was adjudged to have been palmed beyond the goalline by Kameni.
