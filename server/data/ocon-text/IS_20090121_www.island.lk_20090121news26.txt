Speaker W. J. M. Lokubandara yesterday said that the use of microphones by members would be at his discretion. The Speaker said that he decided to step in after parliamentary staff complained to him about some MPs demanding preferential treatment.

Parliament officials had complained that they had come under influence and pressure by some members that they should be given priority in using the microphone facility, the Speaker said.

The Speaker was answering questions raised by Chief Opposition Whip Joseph Michael Perera and JVP Group Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake on why the microphone facility had been switched off whenever the Opposition MPs stand to speak.

Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe: "There is another issue I want to bring to the notice of the Speaker. I made a speech of the assassination of the Sunday Leader editor Lasantha Wickrematunga the other day. When my comments were aired by the BBC, through a tape obtained from Parliament, I found that in the middle of my speech there was a song. After several sentences of my speech a patriotic song comes up. How could this happen. I want to bring this to your (the Speaker's) attention. We should find out whether this occurred while the speech was being taped or while it was being aired."

Speaker Lokubandara: "Some officials have complained to me that they came under heavy pressure from some MPs to be given priority. Therefore, I decided to take control of this. Hereafter only the MPs I name would be given the facility during the debates."
