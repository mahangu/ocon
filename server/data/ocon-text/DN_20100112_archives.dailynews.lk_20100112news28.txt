Bare the pact says Thera

Chamikara Weerasinghe

Ven.Uduwe Dhammaloka Thera said yesterday the agreement entered into between Sarath Fonseka and the Tamil National Alliance could not be treated lightly. Both parties have made contradictory statements on what was agreed.

The Thera was speaking at a press conference in Colombo, organized by National Intellectuals' Fraternity for Protecting Motherland.

Ven. Dhammaloka Thera said that their Fraternity demands Sarath Fonseka to disclose his agreement with the TNA to the public within three days and if he did not they will take to the streets with the people to protest it.

He asked if this was Fonseka's third betrayal of the country for one must not forget that 22 MPs in the TNA camp including Sampanthan have sworn their loyalty to LTTE leader Prabhakaran before they were sworn in Parliament.
