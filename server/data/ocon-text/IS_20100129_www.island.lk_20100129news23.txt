President of the Sri Lanka Small and Medium Industries Aloy R. Jayawardene, in a congratulatory massage to President Mahinda Rajapaksa, states that the victory was written on the wall from the day of the nominations and his organisation extended its congratulations to him for the glorious victory at the Presidential Elections that concluded on Tuesday, his massage said,

"Now is the time to leave behind bitterness of feelings in politics and unite the country for its common good. The problems facing the country are many. It is a supreme irony that we have won a fierce war against terrorism or against the tigers, we have now to win over the Tamil People. This would be possible only if your Excellency comes out with credible proposals that would make the Minority Tamils equal partners in the governance of our country. Your Excellency will have the vision to build this nation and country not on ethnic lines, but to create a true Sri Lankan identity and end confrontational politics that have plagued Mother Lanka for the past 60 years."

"The Small and Medium Sector of Industry are confident that Your Excellency would take up the task in Ernest from the very first day of our magnanimous victory," Jayawardene said.
