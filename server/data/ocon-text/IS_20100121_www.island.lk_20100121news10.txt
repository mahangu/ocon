Deputy Director Public Health Dr. Palitha Maheepala said that the BTI Bacteria from Cuba would arrive in Sri Lanka soon and the Health Ministry would commence the dengue control programme as expected.

Asked why it had not arrived as scheduled, he said that it was a long process involving the Agriculture Department, Environment Ministry and also needed special Cabinet approval. He said this at a media conference held at the Health Education Bureau yesterday.

Dr. Maheepla said that WHO was in the process of importing BTI Bacteria for Sri Lanka. He also said the programme would commence in Kandy and thereafter extended to Anuradhapura, Colombo and Gampaha Districts.

The Epidemiology Unit Chief Dr. Paba Phalihawadana said that initial signs of dengue were fever for more than 48 hours with sneezing, coughing, sore throat and dizziness. Anyone with such symptoms should seek timely medical attention under a qualified doctor, she warned.
