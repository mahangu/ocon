Power and Energy Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne said that a capitalist political party and a political party formed on Marxist principles had never joined in this country though the UNP and the JVP were now working as one. He said that the Opposition combine was taking the people for a ride.

Addressing a gathering at the foundation stone laying a new bus stand at Kuruwita, Seneviratne said the JVP had accused the UNP of killing more than 60,000 men and women during their second abortive insurgency. The UNP was accused of killing JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera in November 1987.

Although the JVP had pledged that it would never deal with the UNP today the JVP had thrown its weight behind the UNP to defeat President Mahinda Rajapaksa, he said. This was nothing but a great betrayal of those, who sacrificed their lives for the JVP, he said adding that the JVP leadership should be ashamed to appear on one political stage with the UNP.

He said the UNP had sold public assets for a song. The Minister said that the JVP had also approved the despicable economic policies of the UNP, thereby accepted global capitalism.
