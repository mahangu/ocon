Cathay Pacific Sri Lanka rewarded their agents who achieved outstanding performance when it comes to ticketing to China, by whisking them away for an unforgettable 8-day visit to the China International Travel Mart in late November. The tour helped to strengthen the business relationship with the agents by giving them a first hand experience of China. It also helped to promote China as a holiday destination and establish tour packages to the mainland. 



 The agents who participated in the tour were Hasitha Peiris from Aitken Spence Overseas Travels, Rodzia Wijemanne from Gabo Travels, Dilshan Godfred from Classic Travels and Fiona Ziegelaar from Hemas Travels. They were accompanied by Cathay's Passenger Sales Supervisor Pravinth Thavarajatheepan. 



 The group visited the Zhou Zhuang of Jiang Su Province that has a long history of building wooden boats, the famous Su Zhou gardens with its museum and Buddha statue and experienced a night tour of Hao River as well as the Museum of reckoning and the Tian Ning Temple in Chang Zhou. 



 "The familiarization tour was a memorable experience for our agents who were successful in promoting China although they have never visited the country before .They successfully sold the wonders that the mainland offered to our discerning passengers thus they certainly deserved to see China for themselves, and Cathay is pleased to extend the opportunity" said Passenger Sales & Marketing Manager, Cathay Pacific Sri Lanka, Ms Ruhan Abbas.
