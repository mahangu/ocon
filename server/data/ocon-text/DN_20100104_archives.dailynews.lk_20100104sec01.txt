"We continuously recruited 5,000 per month for three years to the Security Forces," the Defence Secretary added.

The Government had implemented a strategy to win the war learning from past failures. CSD officials were issued T56 weapons instead of shot guns and they were put through professional training. All the CSD officers were given standard uniforms which gave them honour and dignity. As a result, of around 4,500 CSD officers took part in the final battle against the LTTE, he said.

Addressing the gathering Chief Minister of the North Central Province Berty Premalal Dissanayake said, normality was disturbed in most parts of the North Central Province due to the brutal activities of the LTTE.
