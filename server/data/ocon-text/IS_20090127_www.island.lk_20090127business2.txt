Union Assurance PLC (UA) is a composite insurer transacting both Life and General business, in operation since 1987. It is well placed to provide a caring and efficient service to its clientele, which include many of the largest trading and industrial organisations in Sri Lanka as well as individuals from all walks of life, through an extensive network of 49 branches strategically located throughout the country.

UA was recently commended with the prestigious 'Overall Award For Best Presented Accounts' award at the recently held South Asian Federation of Accountants (SAFA) Awards in India. Union Assurance is the first and only insurer in Sri Lanka to win this 'Overall Award'.

Having bagged this award for the second consecutive year, UA Deputy Chief Executive, Dirk Pereira said: "We won this top award twice and also won the topmost award in the 'Insurance' sector, competing with some of the largest and well-established companies from the South Asian region. The South Asian Federation of Accountants takes into account the financial reports as well as disclosures related to corporate governance, performance management and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). One of the main things they look into is transparency and the extent to which we disclose our information â€“ financial or otherwise."

"Being an insurance company, we deal with public money. In the case of life insurance, we have a Life Fund, where we collect life premiums from our customers. When managing such funds that belong to our customers, we have to act in utmost good faith; in their best interest. We also have internal investment experts who regularly watch the market. They are well qualified, ensuring safe custodianship of policyholders' funds," he added.
