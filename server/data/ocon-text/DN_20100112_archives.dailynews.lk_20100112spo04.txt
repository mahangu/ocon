Lanakn Juniors blast Hong Kong attack

Sri Lanka put up a powerful batting performance to score over 300 runs and beat Hong Kong by 88 runs in their opening warm up match of the International Cricket Council (ICC) Under 19 World Cup cricket tournament which commenced in New Zealand yesterday.

Two Sri Lankans scored centuries as the side ruthlessly dispatched Hong Kong by a convincing margin at Hagley Park, Sri Lanka put in a tremendous batting performance while posting a huge 314 for 1 after they had won the toss and elected to bat first.

The openers Udara Jayasundera and wicket keeper batsman Andri Berenger both scored centuries before retiring. Udara's kncok of 102 came off 112 balls while the more cautious Andri took 127 balls for his contribution of 113 runs.

Hong Kong was never in the running to chase down Sri Lanka's mammoth total despite a dogged fight. Senior Hong Kong international Irfan Ahmad and Auckland-based 15-year old Mark Chapman put on 43 for the fifth wicket, and Chapman was 69 not out at the finish.
