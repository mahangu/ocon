Women's World Cup qualifying event moved from Pakistan due to security concerns

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - A Women's World Cup qualifying event has been moved from Pakistan to South Africa because of security concerns.

The International Cricket Council said Tuesday that the Feb. 18-24 event was switched from Lahore to Port Elizabeth after it received independent security reports.

The eight-nation tournament was originally scheduled to take place in November but postponed until after Pakistan's general election on Jan. 8. That election has now been put back to Feb. 18, with the attendant danger of violence and disruption forcing the move.

"The safety of all participants is our No. 1 priority and, on the basis of the independent advice we have received as well as the material concerns expressed by many of the participating countries, we concluded it was not appropriate to stage the tournament at this time," ICC chief executive Malcolm Speed said.

Bermuda, Ireland, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Scotland, South Africa, and Zimbabwe will compete, with the top two sides clinching a place at the 2009 Women's World Cup in Australia.
