I would be most grateful if some of your knowledgeable readers (lawyers or constitutional lawyers) enlighten me on this.

According to the 1978 Constitution under proportional representation in Parliament, does not the seat of a Member of Parliament become vacant upon his leaving his political party from which he was elected? (That is crossing from the Government to the Opposition and vice-versa).

To fill the vacancy thus created, the candidate from the relevant political party who secured the next highest number of preference votes shall be declared elected after one month. If that is so, why is this not strictly implemented?
