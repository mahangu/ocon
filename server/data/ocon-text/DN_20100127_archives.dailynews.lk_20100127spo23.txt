"I'm in for a good match for sure. I favour my chances in a best-of-five set match. We'll see how it goes," Federer said of Davydenko, while paying tribute to Hewitt.

"I have always had some great battles with Lleyton, he's a champion and has the ability to make you nervous in a match."

Third seed Novak Djokovic, the 2008 winner, also progressed with an emphatic 6-1, 6-2, 7-5 win over Poland's unseeded Lukasz Kubot and will next meet French 10th seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who he beat in the 2008 final.
