NEW DELHI, December 31: India's newly-passed tough anti-terror laws came into effect from today, Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram announced here.

The National Investigative Agency (NIA) Bill and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Amendment Bill became law as President Mrs Pratibha Patil gave her assent to these legislations.

They were passed in the just-concluded session of Parliament in the wake of the horrendous terrorist attacks in Mumbai last month, which claimed over 180 lives.

Chidambaram told reporters that the presidential assent was received today. "The regulations have come into effect from today," he said.

The NIA will get its Director General in a few days. "NIA will be established to investigate terrorist offences. As and when any case is assigned to NIA, it will take up investigation," he said

Chidambaram said the work is in progress to set up 20 counter insurgency and anti-terrorism schools in the country. They will train personnel to tackle cases involving terrorists.

The Home Minister also announced that a round-the-clock

information-gathering-and- sharing centre on terrorism has come into effect from Wednesday.

He said the Ministry will soon bring before the Union Cabinet a note on establishing NSG hubs in four main cities of the country (Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai and Hyderabad). More such hubs will be set up in other cities as well, he added. OVER
