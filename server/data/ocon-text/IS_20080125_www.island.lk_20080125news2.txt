A 9 mm automatic pistol along with a magazine of eleven rounds was discovered near the entrance to the Wilpattu National Park around 7.00 pm on Wednesday where two motor cycles collided head-on injuring both riders.

One rider was an ex-police constable while the other was a home guard. People who gathered at the accident site had found the pistol and the ammunition and handed them over to the Nochchiyagama Police.

None of the accident victims claimed ownership of the weapon.

The injured ex-constable and the home guard have been transferred to the Anuradhapura Hospital from Nochchiyagama for further treatment.
