Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe tri seriesZimbabwe allrounder Elton Chigumbura was adjudged the man of the match as he helped them to an unexpected win over Bangladesh in their tri-series opener in Dhaka, Bangladesh yesterday.



 Chigumbura scored an inspiring half century took a wicket with his medium pace bowling and elso effected a direct hit run out to lead them to a 38 run win in their battle of the minnows. 



 The visitors themselves were in trouble at one stage losing half their wickets with only ninety four runs on the board, but Chigumbura took the lean Zimbabwean tail along with him to double tally and give them a total respectable enough to fight back.



 Bangladesh began their innings in an ungainly manner losing two top order batsmen for 'ducks'. However what hit the home team the most were the three run outs that were subjected on them by the alert Zimbabwean fielders who gave a fine exhibition of ground fielding.



 Apart from that Bangladesh skipper too threw his wicket away by lofting Peter Utseya to long on in an over that he had another partner.



 The only glimmer of hope for Bangladesh came while allrounder Shakib-al Hasan who scored a fine half century was the crease. However he got out while chasing a ball outside the stumps to be held by wicket keeper Taibu off the bowling of Chigumbura for 52.
