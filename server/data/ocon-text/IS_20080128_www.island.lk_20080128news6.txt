The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) is planning to make representations to the Japanese government as part of its efforts to pressure President Mahinda Rajapaksa to suspend ongoing military operations.

A delegation of TNA parliamentarians would shortly visit Tokyo, well informed sources said. Although the visit had been delayed, the TNA would go ahead with it soon, the sources said. Japanese peace envoy Yashushi Akashi would be among the officials the TNA wanted to meet, the sources said, asserting that the TNA would urge Japan to deny financial assistance to Sri Lanka. Although the Japanese government wouldn't want the TNA going on the offensive against Sri Lanka, it didn't want to deny visas to the delegation, the sources said.

The JVP activists based in Japan would launch a protest campaign against the TNA, the sources said. (SF)
