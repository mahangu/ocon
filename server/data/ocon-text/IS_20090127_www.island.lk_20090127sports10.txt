PCB chairman Ejaz Butt said he was extremely disappointed with the way the hosts had surrendered themselves against the Lankans in the final match in Lahore yesterday.

"I have asked the team management, the captain and coach to submit a report by Tuesday as to what went wrong in the final match and the series.

"Obviously the board wants to know what has to be done to rectify the situation and set things right. We can't tolerate such poor performances from anyone," Butt told reporters after attending a meeting of the constitution committee in Lahore today.
