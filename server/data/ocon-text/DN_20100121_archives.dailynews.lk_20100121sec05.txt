Sarath Malalasekera

Colombo Fort Magistrate and Additional District Judge Lanka Jayaratne yesterday refused an application for bail of a director of HICORP (Pvt) Limited, who had been remanded in connection with an alleged arms deal and remanded till February 3.

The Judge in a lengthy order said the CID has a right to submit a confidential report to court in connection with their investigations.

Citing several authorities including Section 123 and 162, the Judge said the defence has no right to peruse the confidential documents submitted to court by the CID.

Senior Defence Counsel A.S.M. Bisma said the confidential report submitted to court had been published in the media. "Who gave this to the media," the Senior Defence Counsel questioned.

CID Chief Inspector Mohan Siriwardena who appeared for the prosecution, vehemently objected to the director being released on bail.

The CID said investigations into the alleged arms deal had not been completed. Chief Inspector Siriwardena said the director had forwarded several forged documents to the Army to obtain the contract for his company.

The CID will submit a comprehensive report in connection with their investigations to court on the next date.

Senior Defence Counsel A.S.M. Bisma with Jayantha Nanayakkara instructed by Shiraz Noordeen appeared for the director.
