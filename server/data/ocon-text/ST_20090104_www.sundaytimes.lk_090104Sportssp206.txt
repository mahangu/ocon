Aussies not out of the woodsA fighting unbeaten knock of 73 by the Australian inform batsman Michael Clarke saw them reaching a tentative 276 for 6 at the end of day one in their third and final Test against South Africa played at the Sydney Cricket Ground, yesterday.

Unlike in the previous two Tests opener Mathew Hayden held on to an unconvincing 168 minutes to make 31 runs and was the third to depart after Simon Katich (47 ) and skipper Rickey Ponting (0) had made their departures.

Although Clarke held on to one end occupying the crease for 151 minutes for his 73 that contained nine fours, Australia lost wickets at regular intervals.

For South Africa who are on mission to finish the series with a 3-0 whitewash all bowlers tried by skipper Graeme Smith bagged a wicket each.

Earlier A.B. McDonald and D.E. Bollinger made their Test debuts for Australia at the expense of allrounder Andrew Symonds and injured fast bowler Brett Lee.
