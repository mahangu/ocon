NewsDirector General/Public Communications of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs A.M.J. Sadiq referring to our news report headlined "Sri Lanka Embassy in Iraq to reopen after FM's visit," published last Sunday states:

 I wish to register my protest and displeasure at the false and misleading statements, which had been directly attributed to me by your reporter in the said news item.



 Your reporter Uditha Jayasinghe telephoned me on Saturday, December 27 and sought my views on the proposal to re-open the Sri Lanka Embassy in Baghdad. While confirming this information, I told your reporter that a decision would be taken on this matter following a visit to Iraq by the Foreign Minister, Hon. Rohitha Bogollagama early next year. 



 It is unfortunate that your reporter has misquoted me as having said that our relations with Iraq have deteriorated. I had only stated that due to the closure of our Mission in Baghdad, our bilateral relations had become neglected and that the Foreign Minister's proposed visit would help to strengthen our traditionally strong ties with Iraq. 



 Moreover, apart from getting the initials of my name wrong, the reporter has also attributed a mischievous comment that "Minister Bogollagama was to kick off his globe trotting spree next year..." to me. I categorically deny having made any such statement. In response to the reporter's query, I merely informed her that the Foreign Minister had planned to make a bilateral visit to Qatar and also a visit to Dubai to meet Sri Lankan Heads of Mission in the Gulf region, next month. 

 News Editor's note: We regret any embarrassment caused to Mr. A.M.J. Sadiq.
