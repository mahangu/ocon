President saddened

President Mahinda Rajapaksa in a message to the President of the Republic of Haiti said:

"I have been deeply saddened to learn about the devastation including the loss of life caused by the recent earthquake in Haiti on January 12, 2010.

On behalf of the people and the Government of Sri Lanka, let me express my deepest condolences to the families who lost their loved ones.

As a nation that was touched by a tragedy of similar magnitude five years ago, Sri Lanka can understand and feel the pain of your sorrow.

I have been informed that the UN peacekeeping battalion from Sri Lanka is fully involved in the rescue efforts. Sri Lanka associates itself with the international community's efforts to support the people of Haiti at this hour of devastation.

The wish of all Sri Lankans is that the people of Haiti will surely find the strength to overcome this tragedy and rebuild their country."
