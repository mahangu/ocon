The people in the North Central Province will endorse 200,000 votes more than the total votes cast for the UPFA at the recent North Central Provincial Council elections at the Presidential elections for President Mahinda Rajapaksa's victory, North Central Provincial Council Chief Minister Berty Premalal Dissanayake said.

Dissanayake was speaking at the inauguration of the Anuradhapura UPFA district election campaign office at Anuradhapura Airport road recently.

The Chief Minister said the people wouldn't be ungrateful to use their franchise to any other candidate than President Mahinda Rajapaksa who worked hard for permanent peace and harmony.

"The Opposition in the cover of a common candidature is making every effort to cheat the public uttering that they are fighting the elections for the cancellation of the Executive Presidency, whereas there are no legal provisions to do such a change at the Presidential elections," he said.

"They are just power greedy and don't possess any reliable overall development plan to strengthen the economy.

The people are intelligent and politically matured," the Chief Minister said.

He said the whole world was well aware the bold decisions the President reached and gallant leadership displayed to eradicate LTTE terrorists and their military fortresses.

"If not for a farsighted and a fearless leader in his calibre, the country would have been still suffering from the curse of the LTTE.

"Such a great national hero should not be betrayed at any cost just for political advantage," the Chief Minister said.
