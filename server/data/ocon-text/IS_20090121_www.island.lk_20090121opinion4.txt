I wonder if any knowledgeable reader of your journal could enlighten me as to whether there's an existing record in the pages of the Guinness Book for the longest period a man has survived without a mobile phone? If there isn't one, I wish to create one as I have by now lasted two years four months and thirteen days since I had to give up on retirement, the one I was given by the company I worked for!
