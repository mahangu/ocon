A new era was dawn to Kandy District since this Government came to power. Among the services rendered by the government during the period 2005-2009, the road net work covering the District takes prominence.

Since gaining Independence in 1948, the successive rulers had shown a lethargic attitude providing a satisfactory road network to Kandy district. Most of the roads were dilapidated and especially roads in the rural areas were with pot holes.

Almost all the Governments abandoned the proposals to lay tar or to concrete the gravel roads in difficult rural areas merely saying that funds are not available.

However the Ministry of Highways dealt with a feasibility study and drew a blue print to repair or to construct newly a large number of roads in the District. The President forthwith instructed the Highways Ministry to expedite the work as specified in this blue-print.

Developing the Kandy-Mahiyangana road is one of the major projects undertaken by the Government. Kandy-Mahiyangana road is famous because of its 18 bends. Very often especially during rainy seasons, the road is closed due to its dilapidated position. The motorists evaded using the road since it caused constant accidents.

The Kandy-Mahiyangana road development project commenced in 2008 and scheduled to be completed in 2011 with an expenditure to a tune of Rs. 4800 mn. The Asian Development Bank funds the project.
