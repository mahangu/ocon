Rs 500m letter demand sent to Mangala

Commandant Civil Defence Force Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekara's Attorney-at-Law has sent a letter demand for Rs. 500 million to SLFP (M) Member of Parliament Mangala Samaraweera stating that two defamatory public statements had been made of Rear Admiral Weerasekara by Samaraweera on December 29, 2009 and January 1, 2010 alleging that Rs. 1,500 million from the Commandant's Fund had been given for the election campaign of President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

The letter demand also states that Samaraweera had also alleged that the Commandant's Fund money referred to was given by Rear Admiral Weerasekara to the President's election campaign expecting nominations to contest as a UPFA candidate.

These public statements were false and defamatory of the Rear Admiral.
