Overseas School of Colombo will be holding its yearly Walk for the Wetlands fund raising drive on Sunday January 27th. This is an annual tradition that has been organized by the school and the active parent community (through the Parent Teacher Associaton) for the last 15 or so years. In recent years the focus has been on wetlands conservation with a special emphasis on the nearby Talangama Wetlands. This ancient tank is host to an impressive number of birds, animal and plant species and plays a crucial role in the hydrology of the area. It is under threat from nearby construction and contamination from garbage. This year OSC is taking a global approach linking the fragile state of wetlands to the problem of climate change. The theme of this year's walk is "Walk for the World Walk for the Wetlands."

The walk is designed to raise awareness about and funds for the protection and conversation of Sri Lanka's wetland ecosystems. A number of corporate sponsors as well as individual donations from walkers helps make this a successful way to raise funds. Last year about 200,000 rupees was raised for this cause. The Overseas School of Colombo has a long relationship with the Field Ornithology Group of Sri Lanka. The funds have allowed FOGS to produce publications (books, posters etc.) and conduct educational campaigns in the Talangama area. In recent years the school community has also been able to support conservation activities by the Galle Naturalists Society at their site Hiyare reservoir.
