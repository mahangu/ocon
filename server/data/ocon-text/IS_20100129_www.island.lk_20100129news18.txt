Minister G. L. Peiris and National Freedom Front leader Wimal Weerawansa, MP, yesterday said that a defeat for the incumbent President at Tuesday's presidential poll would have caused countrywide chaos with the Opposition targeting Temple Trees, Janadhipathi Mandiraya and other important offices.

They said the country would have been plunged into unprecedented crisis causing a situation which had not been experienced by Sri Lanka previously. Addressing the media at the BMICH, Weerawansa said that the Opposition had moved in to Cinnamon Lakeside shortly after polling ended as it planned to direct operations from there.

A smiling MP said that the Opposition was confident of Fonseka's victory, a former top aide (name withheld) to a VVIP (name withheld) had phoned the staff at the Presidential Secretariat and asked them to be prepared as the Opposition candidate would be sworn in the day after the poll. He emphasised that there had been no previous instance where any politician, his associates and bodyguards had occupied at a five star hotel at the end of polling.

Minister Peiris said that the Opposition had made what he called a despicable attempt to discredit the country by accusing the government of denying the Opposition candidate freedom of movement, restraining Polls Chief Dayananda Dissanayake and an influential government personality exerting pressure on Dissanayake.

Minister Peiris said that the Opposition strategy had been directed at the international community though it could not deceive the Sri Lankans. He urged the Opposition not to engage in pity politics at the expense of the country.
