The Island-SportsFormer Sri Lanka cap Indika de Saram propped up his club, Ragama CC, as they overtook the strong Bloomfield and Singhalese Sports Club to grab the Tier 'A' table leader's position after the seventh weekend of this season's SLC–organised Premier League cricket tournament.

Saram's timely 103, which he made in just 118 balls last weekend over Bloomfield – that was incidentally his third ton in four innings in the tournament - caused the latter to suffer a 3-wkcket defeat and lose their top place in the tables. Now, with only five rounds left in the segment, Ragama enjoy an over 10-point lead over the present second place holders Bloomfield. (See table).

Meanwhile, the penultimate and eighth weekend of Tier 'B' will begin today with Saracens SC as its table leaders. Seeduwa Raddoluwa CC and Panadura SC are well below Saracens, occupying second and third places respectively.
