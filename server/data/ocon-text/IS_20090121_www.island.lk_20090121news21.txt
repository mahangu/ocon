Eyebrows are raised over a move to send an official with the Ports and Aviation Ministry for a three-day workshop in the UK organized by the International Maritime Organisation (IOM).

Well informed sources said that nothing could be as ridiculous as sending him overseas as the Sri Lankan taxpayer's expense as he would retire in March this year. This was going to be a sojourn, the sources said, adding that Sri Lanka should have been represented by an expert who would have contributed to the growth of the local industry. The powers that be were going ahead with their move to send the official who some time ago came under fire for using two official vehicles regardless a specific government directive against abuse of vehicles.
