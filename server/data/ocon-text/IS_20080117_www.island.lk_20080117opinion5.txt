Under the caption 'Deviant Doctors' Dr. A. G. Abeywickrama, in The Island of Jan. 8, explains that the guillotine has been the brain child of a doctor and that there is also surgical instrument by that name. The first one is used for beheading and the other for 'excising ovula' etc.

Dr. Abeywickrama would be interested to know that chairmen of meetings also use this Guillotine to bring the proceedings of a meeting to an abrupt end as a method of time management. I do not know of the individual who first used this method. We learnt about this term in the course of our studies about all aspects of the conduct of meetings. It, however, is not a cutting instrument but serves the same purpose. The Speaker of our Parliament could use it to save a lot of the cost of Hansard!
