The Ministry of Education on Monday extended the provision of free midday meals for schoolchildren for another year. The programme commenced two years ago as outlined by the Mahinda Chintana manifesto under educational sector development policies, a spokesman for the Ministry told The Island.

The two-year implementation of the programme has been able to reduce the number of under weight children by seven percent, he said quoting ministry statistics. It is reported that nearly 30 percent of school children who attended schools in 2005 came to school without breakfast, he said.

The Ministry spokesman said that the programme had contributed to increase the school attendance and prevented children from eating unhealthy foods.

One million students in grade 1 to V classes in 7618 government schools enjoy free midday meals for the last two years. The Ministry had spent Rs. 2700 million for this purpose. The continuation of the programme for this year (2010) would cost Rs. 2,900 million, the spokesman said.

The World Food Programme and Ministries of Health and Nation Building had assisted the Ministry to make this programme a success, he said.
