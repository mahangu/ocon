Secretary to the President and UNESCAP's ICT Committee Chairman Lalith Weertunga extolled the value of innovative thinking at the National Chief Innovative Officers' Conference held in Colombo recently.

Participating at the conference as the chief guest, Weeratunga emphasised, in his key note address, the value of thinking creatively and figuring out new ways for providing service smartly to the public. He said that in public service there were numerous instances where a little creative thinking could lead to simple and small projects that would carry out the tasks faster, at less cost, in a more pleasant manner and in a less cumbersome way both for the government servant as well as the public. The audience of this conference organized by the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA) consisted mainly of senior government officials who form the pivotal part in the machinery for implementing the eGovernment programme.

The National Chief Innovative Officers have been playing a central role in executing the eGovernment programme from 2005. Annually they have been exposed to local and foreign experts and practitioners in eGovernment to increase their know-how in eGovernment. This time at this annual conference the CIO's were exposed to local experts and practitioners in eGovernment and given an opportunity to get into groups and plan feasible eGovernment projects which they could take to their work areas and implement.

Introducing the day's programme, ICTA eGovernment programme Director, Wasantha Deshapriya said : "Today we complete four years of the eGovernment programme. As 2008 ends and 2009 dawns we move from phase one to phase two in the path of eGovernment. The year 2009 has been declared the year of ICT and English. It can also be called the year of eGovernment".
