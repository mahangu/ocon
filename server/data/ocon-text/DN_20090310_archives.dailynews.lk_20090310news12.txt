Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse NewspapersHard work done by the Transport Ministry to improve the country's transport services and cater to the needs of both the travelling public and the workers is now slowly bearing fruit and the day when train services to Jaffna will be resumed is not far away said Transport Minister Dallas Alahapperuma. The Minister who noted that the President had a keen interest in the development of the railways emphasised that the Government would never sell or privatise the railways. Alahapperuma who noted that any endeavour launched with a firm conviction and objective sans corruption was bound to succeed added that his Ministry was prepared to improve the railway in consultation with the workforce through discussion and consensus. Alahapperuma said the Railway Department was saving expenditure on 300 litres of diesel per day after using a power set for the 'Samudra Devi' morning office train. He said a vast majority commuters liked the new train but a few whose leisure activities like card games have been hampered were making a big hue and cry against the deployment of the power set. Posts and Telecommunication Minister Mahinda Wijesekera said the Railways and Posts and Telecommunications were two departments with a long history of service which rendered vital service to the people. The Posts and Telecommunications Department too had suffered losses last year like the Railways. But they could be easily transformed into profitable ventures through proper planning. An allnight Pirith ceremony was held on Sunday followed by a heel dana yesterday morning as part of the ceremony. Other highlights included the issuing of a commemorative stamp, issuing a gazette notification declining the Dematagoda yard as an ancient monument, launching of a website and handing over of some M-7 engines to the yard for reform and maintenance.
