The navy Monday night succeeded in intercepting an LTTE group operating in the Kuchchaveli jungles. SLN combat troops had ambushed the group at 7.30 pm and during a brief but fierce exchange of fire hit at least ten LTTE cadres.

SLN spokesperson Commander D.K.P. Dassanayake said that troops recovered three bodies along with four T 56 assault rifles, magazines, ammunition and a stock of medical items and dry rations. A member of the LTTE medical unit was believed to have been among the ambushed group, he said, revealing that the 'LTTE doctor' would have been one of the four personnel who had been with the fighting cadres deployed in the East last year.

The Island learns that about 30 LTTE cadres are operating in the Kuchchaiveli-Peraru region. Dassanayake said that their task was to disturb the Trincomalee district.

About 20 LTTE cadres had been involved in Monday's engagement, one of the biggest in the Trincomalee district after security forces had evicted them from the Eastern Province. Dassanayake said that the operation to neutralise the enemy group would continue with the Special Boat Squadron and the Special Operations Group spearheading the action.

He said that steps would be taken to hand over the recovered bodies to the ICRC to be transferred to the Vanni.
