1) The Minister stated that Pension Receipts hitherto issued to Pensioners together with their Pensions payments should be restored forthwith;

2) Issue of Pension Receipts was stopped as a measure to save Govt. expenditure & extra work involved;

3) Accordingly, Director of Pensions was ordered by the Minister to make the issue of Pension Receipts compulsory.

FR Application. No. 352/2006 filed by Kesbewa Govt. Pensioners Association was settled by the Supreme Court on the understanding given by the authorities that the Pensions Receipts issue would be restored forthwith.

Director of Pensions by his Circular No. 10/2006 (II) of 7.5.07 instructed Div. Secys to commence issue of Pension Receipts to all Pensioners in deference to request made by Pension Association and Senior Citizens.

This decision is implemented faithfully by Colombo Kachcheri Div. Secretariat without a breach as we know from those who draw pensions from that office.

However, it is not the case with Maharagama Div. Secretariat. Their convenient interpretation is that in cases where variations occur only, they would issue Receipts. For instance my net pension credited to Bank varies from month to month due to substantial deductions. But, I don't get receipts to keep track of deductions.

This, I believe, amounts to contempt of court. It appears that hapless Pensioner have been taken for a right royal ride.

Will the Minister intervene to ensure that justice is done and his order carried out?
