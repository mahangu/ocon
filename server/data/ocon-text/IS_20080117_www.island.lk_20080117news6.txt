The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) yesterday warned the Health Ministry that unless immediate steps are taken to guarantee the safety, accommodation and transport facilities of doctors serving in the North and East it won't hesitate to resort to strike action.

This follows an assault on a Senior House Officer, Dr. Upendra Wijeratne, attached to the Trincomalee base hospital last Sunday. He had been assaulted by three unidentified persons while in his quarters. He has now been admitted to the Colombo National hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

Before assaulting him the assailants had also demanded Rs.1 million from Dr. Wijeratne and had administered an injection. Thereafter he had fallen unconscious.

GMOA General Secretary Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya said that the GMOA had decided to visit all hospitals in the North and East in order to assess the safety and security provided for doctors and their transport facilities. The GMOA was not satisfied with the current provision of security for doctors by the government and was awaiting an assurance for better security, accommodation and better transport facilities from the Health Ministry Secretary Dr. Athula Kahandaliyanage.

Dr. Padeniya also said that Dr. Wijeratne's condition was improving and the GMOA was expecting a full report of the incident from the police. An impartial inquiry should be conducted and justice meted out. The three men involved in the incident should be brought to the book. The Medical profession in the North and East was a risky one and the GMOA was grateful that all doctors were serving in those areas with a sense of responsibility and dedication, he said.
