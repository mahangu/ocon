Two gunmen fired at a bus carrying a group of people on their way to a UNP rally at Tissamaharama killing 55-year-old Kusumawathie Kuruppuarachchi and wounding two others.

The police said the gunmen had attacked the bus on the Tangalle-Hungama road. Police said that the victim was a resident of Vitharanadeniya, Weerakekitiya.

UNP Hambantota District MP Sajith Premadasa alleged

that the attackers were UPFA supporters. According to him, the main suspect's father had been the Chairman of a Pradeshya Sabha in the Hambantota District. Responding to our queries, Premadasa said that he had organised a meeting at Tissamaharama to coincide with his birthday. He said that there was no truth in claims that Opposition presidential candidate General (Retd) Sarath Fonseka was to attend the meeting. He accused the police of turning a blind eye to political violence directed at the UNP.

The Hungama police have arrested the main suspect and recovered a T-56 assault rifle.

The Centre for Monitoring Election Violence yesterday urged Polls Chief Dayananda Dissanayake's immediate intervention to arrest the situation. According to a CMEV spokesperson, the wounded had been first rushed to the government hospital at Tangalle before Kusumawathie was transferred to the Matara hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries.
