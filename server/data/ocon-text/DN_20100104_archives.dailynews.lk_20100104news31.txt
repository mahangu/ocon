Bentota Kashyapa Dalada Perahera

* Biggest cultural pageant in South

* Interrupted several times

* Ushers cultural renaissance

Minister Weerakoon said Sri Lanka should be proud to have a leader like President Mahinda Rajapaksa. His peace concept brought development and progress to the country, the Minister said.

The Dalada Maha Perahera held in veneration of the Sacred Tooth Relic of Arahat Anubuddha Maha Kashyapa by the Bentota Galapatha Raja Maha Vihara is regarded as the biggest cultural pageant of the Southern Sri Lanka from the time of kings.

Chief Incumbent of Galapatha Raja Maha Vihare, Ven. Sigiriye Anoma Thera said the Perahera was interrupted several times due to many reasons.

Steps have been taken to revive the Perahera by the late Ven. Elakake Pannawasa Nayaka Thera and former Ministers, assisted by several people since 1976.

The prelate said Bentota once the home of great scholars, both clergy and laymen, is today a tourist resort which attracts foreign visitors in large numbers to the Dalada Perahera. A historical pageant of this nature will not only usher a cultural renaissance but also restore Buddhism and Buddhist ecclesiastic institutions to their pristine glory, he said.
