Australia bound: Arrested on Marawila shore

CHAMINDA PERERA

Marawila Police yesterday arrested 10 persons including nine Tamils for attempting to migrate to Australia illegally by sea off Katuneriya. The Tamils were residents of Mannar, Killinochchi and Jaffna districts.

According to Police spokesman SSP Ranjith Gunasekera , the boat they boarded had returned due to a technical fault and these people had been waiting for another fishing boat at the Marawila shore when the arrest was made.

SSP Gunasekera said, the mastermind of this human smuggling racket was also taken into custody after the arrestees were extensively interrogated by the police. "Police have now established that he has charged millions of Rupees from the people seeking migration to Australia.

Police believe the rest of the people who were on board might have fled the area after the technical fault developed in the boat.
