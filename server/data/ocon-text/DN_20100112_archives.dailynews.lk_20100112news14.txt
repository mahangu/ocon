Sri Lanka's state-of-the-art theatre with the most modern equipment is being constructed changing the entire landscape of the Nomads playground leaving nostalgic memories for some of the players who shed their sweat at this green field, a senior officer of the Cultural Ministry said.

Yet it will be another unique place for not only the artistes but all Sri Lankans. It is a gift from the People's Republic of China and will cost around Rs. 3.45 billion.

It will be one of the finest theatre complexes in South Asia, officials said. The entire land area of the Nomads grounds is 2.17 hectares and two thirds of it would be used for the construction of the theatre. It would accommodate 1,688 persons.

It will be equipped with modern audio visual facilities. An underground car park for 350 vehicles is also being constructed, she added. The main structure of the theatre building is complete and the interior finishing touches are in progress.

The Rs. 3.45 billion theatre with Chinese assistance will pave way for more Sri Lankans to develop drama, dance and other forms of visual arts providing opportunities for artistes in the future.
