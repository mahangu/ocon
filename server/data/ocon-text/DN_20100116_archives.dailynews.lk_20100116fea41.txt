Despite dismal economy, luxury on display at US auto show

Despite a recession-shaken global economy, this year's North American International Auto Show features a surprising number of luxury cars tailored for drivers in search of the best wheels money can buy.

The leading brands in luxury are all here: Corvettes, Bentleys, Maseratis, Cadillacs - names that cause heart palpitations as much for their pricetags as for their performance.

But after a lackluster year in car sales, some well-heeled customers appear willing to pay top-dollar for high performance and an aura of automotive elegance. Among the car companies pushing its appeal to high-end customers is Daimler, maker of the storied Mercedes Benz.

The company expects to gain market share this year in a revived global automobile market, after what the German carmaker acknowledged was a challenging 2009.

Daimler says its prospects are bright for the current year, after a year of reorganization and soul-searching.

"We used the time to do our homework and get a very promising base for 2010," said Daimler chairman Dieter Zetsche.

He said there was "strong momentum" for Daimler brands, including Mercedes, during the fourth quarter of 2009 that gives the company "a lot of confidence" heading into 2010.

"That's why with a cautiously optimistic market (growth) forecast of three to four percent worldwide, we are more optimistic for the development of Mercedes in 2010," he said Monday. "We expect to gain some market share in 2010." Electric-vehicle producer Tesla Motors believes it has come up with a winning combination with its Roadster - a car the California-based company said proves that luxury and environmental efficiency can co-exist in the same vehicle.
