Retired Justice of the Court of Appeal G. W. Edirisuriya has decided to inquire into the petition filed to the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka by the Assistant Secretary of the UNP Dr. Jayalath Jayawardane MP against the Secretary to the Ministry of Defence Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and several others.

In his petition Dr. Jayawardane has alleged that on an order from the Secretary of Defence Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Major General Lalith Daulagala of the Sri Lanka Army caused his removal in person from the Holy Shrine of 'Our Lady of Madhu' on August 14, 2008 whilst he was in prayer and meditation in the inner chamber of the Holy Shrine.

He states that by this act the Secretary of Defence and other respondents, named in his petition, violated the fundamental rights guaranteed to him by Articles 10. 12 and 14 (2) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka.

The presiding judge ordered summons to be issued on the added respondents Major General Lalith Daulgala and the Army Commander returnable on January 23, 2009. The judge also ordered that copies of all documents marked as exhibits to the petition be sent to the First Respondent by registered post.

Attorney-at-law Indunil Bandara appeared for the Defence Secretary who was not present. The second respondent was neither present nor legally represented at the inquiry.

Desmond Fernando P.C with K. D. C. Kumarage, SSM Samsudeen and Lasitha Muhandiramge, attorneys-at-law instructed by attorney Suranga Bandara appeared for Dr. Jayawardane who was present at the inquiry.

Dr. Jayawardane, the petitioner, who replied to the questions raised by the media, stated that this petition was filed by him before the Commission not to win his personal right to religion and conscience but to win this right for all the Roman Catholics and people professing other religions in the whole of Sri Lanka.
