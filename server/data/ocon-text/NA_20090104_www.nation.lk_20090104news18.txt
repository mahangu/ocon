NewsKaruna says Prabha still in Mullaitivu Scotching speculation that LTTE Leader Velupillai Prabhakaran has fled the country due to his inability to resist the present onslaught by the government troops, Tamil Makkal Vidudalai Puligal (TMVP) Leader and Parliamentarian Vinayagamoorthy Muralidaran alias Karuna yesterday confirmed that the LTTE Chief was still living in the thick jungles of Mullaitivu.



 Karuna, quoting top level TMVP intelligence sources, told The Nation yesterday that Prabhakaran continued to give military leadership to his cadres from the jungles. He categorically denied speculations that LTTE Leader Prabhakaran had crossed the Palk Straits, seeking refuge from the Tamil Nadu Government.



 Describing the fall of Kilinochchi as a great victory for the government forces in general and President Mahinda Rajapaksa in particular, he said he was confident that the troops would capture Mullaitivu shortly. Karuna said the government should now open the A9 main supply road and take proper care of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).



 He also requested the civilians trapped in the Wanni to break through Tiger lines and soon enter safe areas. "The people did this in the east. They broke the main lines and entered Vakarai. They in fact, defied the LTTE order not to do so. So, I am requesting the people to do this and enter the government controlled areas," he said.



 Karuna was of the opinion that the fall of Kilinochchi was a huge blow to the Tamil diaspora, who he said had blindly believed that the LTTE can never be pushed out of Kilinochchi.



 "Now they will realise that the LTTE is weak. In fact, there was no major fight in Kilinochchi as the LTTE had withdrawn from the area. My dream is that the north would soon be liberated so that the people could be relieved from all sorts of harassments," he said.
