Presidential candidate Sarath Fonseka urged the voters to seize the opportunity to build on the security forces' triumphs over the LTTE to usher in reconciliation, prosperity, development and true peace. He used his first national address over state-run electronic media to emphasise the importance of defeating the incumbent President.

In his address aired by the Channel Eye TV as per the Election Commission's guidelines to provide a level-playing field to all candidates contesting the January 26 presidential election, the former Army Chief reiterated his pledge to abolish Executive Presidency while targeting the government and the president over corruption and nepotism.

In his New Year message the retired General said, "It was a year of immense triumph on the one hand winning the war, while on the other, we lost tragically on not exploiting the opportunities. As we stand at the entrance of a new decade, people looked forward to a bright future following the war victory accomplished by defeating the menace of terrorism seven months ago. Let not these hopes of the people be dashed to the ground".

"On this auspicious day, I wish to promise that if selfish family rule, corruption and nepotism are defeated at the forthcoming election, people's wishes, hopes and aspirations can be fulfilled; and a people's new year 2010 shall be ushered in," he said.
