 It said:

 The Golden Key Credit Card Company is only one amongst the Ceylinco Group of Companies. 

 The good news is that the value of the security deposits of the Golden Key Credit Card Company is not the speculated Rs. 26 billion, but it is even less than half of this amount. 

 I am happy to announce that we have already commenced refunding security deposits as promised, from its smallest value upwards. 



 This process will continue in the months to come. 

 The Ceylinco Group has, over its 65-year-old history, faced a bomb blast, riots, tsunami and many dangers and trials in our journey through life. We have with us customers who love Ceylinco and have been our clients from generations to generations. 



 To them, most importantly of all, I must mention that the refunding of the Security Deposits of the Golden Key Credit Card Company is being done and will be done in future in such a manner without destabilising any of the companies in the Ceylinco Group. 

 I am sure that our loyal customers will continue to be with us ensuring that the Ceylinco Group companies will maintain their stability, goodwill and the public confidence.
