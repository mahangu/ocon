The Ministry of Education has undertaken a project to upgrade selected schools in major towns in a bid to prevent parents competing to admit their children to popular schools.

Steps were taken last year to provide Rs. 120 million to 150 schools to facilitate the upgrading.

Science laboratories, libraries, new class rooms, more qualified teachers and playgrounds and several other facilities were provided to attract parents to admit their children, the Education Ministry announced yesterday.

Funds have already been provided to upgrade another 150 schools during the current year, it said.
