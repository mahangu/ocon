This writer had the good fortune of seeing Rahul Dravid some years back when he was deputy to Sourav Ganguly.

He's cool, modest and a Gentleman to the core.

Eranga Jayawardene (now with AP) and I were at one of the warm up games, where Dravid was 12th man.

Pacie Javagal Srinath bowled a few overs of high speed stuff and then was fielding close to the boundary line. He badly needed a drink and asked us whether we could let his mates know about it. I walked up to the Indian dressing room and do you know who carried the drinks for Javagal?

It was the charming Rahul Dravid! Incredible, indeed. I was reminded of what Jesus Christ said about not lording it over people, but that one should serve.
