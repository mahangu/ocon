Sri Lanka Under-19 gained a huge morale boost ahead of the ICC Under-19 World Cup proper as they beat India Under-19, who got the better of them in the recently held Tri-Nation tournament in South Africa, by seven runs in a practice match played at Christchurch, yesterday.

The Sri Lankan spinners restricted the Indians to 156 runs in their allotted 26 overs to record a thrilling seven run win. The match was played as a 26 overs a side affair due to rain.

Maduka Liyanapathiranage gave away just 17 runs in his six over spell and picked up a wicket. Rushan Jaleel, Rumesh Buddhika and Danushka Gunathilaka also picked up a wicket each.

Sri Lanka's victory yesterday provides them with a huge morale boost ahead of the World Cup proper as they suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of India in the Tri-Nation tournament held in South Africa early this month.

The ICC Youth World Cup will commence on Jan. 15 and Sri Lanka's first match will be on the 17th.
