CONI calls for lifetime ban for Barbi

The Italian Olympic committee's anti-doping office called for distance-runner Rober to Barbi to receive a lifetime ban Thursday.

Barbi tested positive for EPO and ephedrine following the Mende half marathon in France. It was his third doping violation.

Prior to the 2001 world championships in Edmonton, Barbi received a four-year ban for using EPO, which was reduced to 25 months following an appeal. He first tested positive in 1996, receiving a three-month ban for ephedrine.
