The Island-NewsThe Government has allocated Rs.250 million to supply electricity to all villages in the Central Province. Villages in the Kandy, Matale and Nuwara-Eliya districts will benefit, the Power and Energy Ministry said.

Power and Energy Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne told The Island that under the Iranian aid and CIDA (A Swedish based company) Matale will receive loan facilities of Rs.75 million, Nuwara-Eliya Rs.75 million and Kandy Rs.100 million.

He said that the ongoing construction of power generation projects would be completed as soon as possible because the a number of power generation projects scheduled for completion in 2006, 2007 and 2008, under the centralised budget allocations, could not be completed.

Minister Seneviratne said the Ministry was positive that before the end of 2009 all remote villages across the country would be supplied with electricity.
