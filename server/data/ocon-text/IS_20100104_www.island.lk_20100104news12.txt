Friday, Jan 01: RAMANATHAPURAM: Five Sri Lankan Tamil refugees, including three children, arrived at Mukundarayar Chathiram near Dhanushkodi on Thursday. This was reportedly the first since the end of the war between LTTE and Sri Lankan armed forces in May this year.

The refugees told the police and intelligence agencies that they had boarded a boat at Talaimannar in Sri Lanka at 2 a.m. and landed at Mukundarayar Chathiram around 5 a.m. From there they travelled to the Dhanushkodi police station. R. Vigitha, one of the refugees, said she had given her gold chain as fee for ferrying her family to Tamil Nadu.

Asked about the reason for seeking asylum in Tamil Nadu, Vigitha said the police and other agencies had been looking at Tamils with suspicion always.

They were subjected to sudden inquiry or summoned for interrogation. "The situation in Sri Lanka is still not conducive for peaceful living. Tamils do not know when they will be interrogated or and summoned," she said.

To a question, Vigitha said there was no problem in hiring a boat to India [though it was illegal], as the security agencies had relaxed their surveillance along the shore. Several Tamils, who returned to their homeland by various means including illegal passage from India after being given asylum, were eager to come to India basically to revive their registration.
