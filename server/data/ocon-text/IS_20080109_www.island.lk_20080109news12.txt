KANDY â€“ The list of names of the children selected to Grade one of Kingswood College, Kandy had not been published even on Tuesday (8) yesterday although it was expected to be made known to the parents by December 31, last year.

The delay has caused anxiety among parents.

It was due to the absence of a member of the selection board of the children for his signature. The particular member could not be traced till yesterday, parents said.

Sources said yesterday (8) that the principal of the school was instructed by the heads of the Provincial Education Department to put up the list of names without the signature of the missing member of the selection board.
