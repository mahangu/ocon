Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union (CEBEU) yesterday expressed concern over three new posts created by CEB Chairman Udayasri Kariyawasam including the post of Fund Manager to the CEB.

A senior engineer of the Union expressed fears in an interview with The Island yesterday that in the creation of these posts there are plans to play with the provident fund of the CEB. It is a doubt shared by all engineers.

Union sources said that Chairman recently instructed CEB General Manager Ranjith Pulleperuma to recruit a Fund Manager to manage CEB accounts despite having an accountant a head for Information Technology and head for Human Resources. All three are alleged to be close associates of the Chairman, according to the engineers.

Kariyawasam had also requested the General Manager to recruit an engineer of the CEB who was suspended six years ago on corruption charges, under the instruction of a parliamentarian representating the United National Party.

The Island learns that most of the CEB Board members are against the Chairman's move.

Meanwhile, the Engineers Union also said that they will take up the matter shortly with Power and Energy Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne. "If the minister takes a decision against us, we would be compelled to take trade union action", another executive committee member said yesterday.
