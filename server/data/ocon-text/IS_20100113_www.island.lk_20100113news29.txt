Expelled UNP member and former Deputy Mayor of Colombo, Azad Sally, yesterday said that 60 per cent of the minority vote will be in favour of Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Addressing the media in Colombo, he said anti-Muslim forces such as US, Britain and Norway are supporting Gen. Sarath Fonseka and if Sarath Fonseka is elected president of this country, the minorities will have to emigrate.

"There is an insidious campaign by countries such as US, Britian, the EU and Norway to oust President Rajapaksa," Sally said.

Asked by a reporter whether he has joined the SLFP, Sally answered in the negative. "Though I have been expelled from the party of Ranil Wickremesinghe, I still am a UNPer.

"The day a politician of the calibre of Karu Jayasuriya takes the reigns of the UNP, I will return to the party," he said.

Sally described Ranil Wickremesinghe as a selfish leader and a born loser and said that he was responsible for the deterioration of the party.

Under Wickremesinghe's leadership, the party has lost 16 elections which proves that he is not capable of leading the party.

Sally lashed out at Wickremesinghe, claiming that the UNP leader was being controlled by the international community and before he takes a decision, he is in the habit of consulting ambassadors of the respective countries which dictates terms to him, he said.

The former Prime Minister is a lap dog of the international community and keeps swallowing the dead ropes given by the ambassadors, the former Deputy Mayor said.

Wickremesinghe has betrayed the party by aligning with the JVP where the Marxist party has killed top leaders of the party and over 6,000 of its members, Sally said, adding that this alliance will never succeed.

The Common Opposition boasts that 20 Parliamentarians from the UPFA will join them, but so far no one has joined them except for people like Sellasamy and Yogarajan who have been losers all the time, he said.
