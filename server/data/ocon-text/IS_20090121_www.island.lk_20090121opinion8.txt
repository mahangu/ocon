Yesterday I watched a show on MBO warning the world of the disasters that can take place in the future, If we do not pay heed to & take measures to prevent global warming.

I recommend that the government of Sri Lanka for its part, as a measure to arrest global warming, could ban vehicles releasing more than the statutory limit of carbon monoxide.

All the natural disasters that have taken place, like the tsunami, earthquakes etc that have taken place recently have been as a result of global warming. Therefore, remedial action is required immediately.
