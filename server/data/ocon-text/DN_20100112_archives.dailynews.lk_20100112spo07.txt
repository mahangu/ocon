Former world number three David Nalbandian pulled out of the Heineken Open Monday, throwing his Australian Open plans into serious doubt. On the comeback trail after hip surgery in May, the Argentinian suffered an abdominal strain while warming up and will miss what would have been his first tournament in eight months.

"I am very disappointed not to be able to make my comeback this week at the Heineken Open. I was very much looking forward" to playing in Auckland once again, said Nalbandian, currently ranked 63.

"I didn't play much tennis for eight months so it is natural to suffer some small injuries. Although I am disappointed at the moment, I remain confident and positive about making a full-time comeback to the tour soon," he added.

Tournament director Richard Palmer said similar abdominal injuries take 10 to 15 days to heal. The Australian Open, the season's opening Grand Slam, is due to start on Monday.

Only three first round matches were played Monday, with the rest of the round to be completed on Tuesday.
