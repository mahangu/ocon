The sale of illicit beef at the Kalutara public market continues unchecked while the Urban Council remains silent, residents allege.

The situation worsened after the Kalutara slaughter house was closed following protests from Buddhists because of its proximity to the Kalutara Bodhiya, the most sacred religious place in the Kalutara district.

Beef to the Kalutara market is supplied from slaughter houses in Beruwala and illegal abattoirs in the Kalutara urban area. There is no proper certification from a Public Health Inspector for beef sold at the market, residents say.

This issue was discussed at the monthly meeting of Urban Council presided by chairman M. S. M. Mubarak but no decision was taken to suspend the illicit slaughter of cattle within the Urban Council limits in Kalutara.
