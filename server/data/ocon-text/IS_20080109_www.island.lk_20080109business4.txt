"Knowledge alone will not make a student a perfect person," said the Auxiliary Bishop of Colombo, Dr. Marius Peiris, who was the Chief Guest at the Graduation Day of the English Language Immersion Course held at Nimani Centre, Wanaluwawa, recently.

Rev. Fr. Merl Mendis OMI, Director of Nimani Centre, deserves a big bouquet for his indefatigable efforts in conducting the very useful English Language Immersion Course for the sixth consecutive year. All post A/L students who have completed this Course owe him a debt of gratitude.

His Lordship reminded the students and their parents that the correct notion of Integral Education is not merely book knowledge, but three other aspects of learning which the student has to master. These are learning to do something, learning to live properly, and learning to live with others. The15-week Residential Course has tried to instill in the students these four aspects of education.

Director of the Nimani Centre Fr. Merl Mendis in his report stressed that the primary or main purpose of this Life-Education course is character formation and personality development. Efficiency in English and effective communication are secondary purposes of the course. He said this year, out of 28 students who participated in the course in September, only 15 succeeded in completing it. These post A/L students came from 13 different parishes of the Archdiocese of Colombo. Eight out of the fifteen students have attended private Catholic schools, while the rest have attended Government schools. He thanked the parents and well-wishers who contributed generously to make the course a success.

The course is recommended to post A/L students and it is hoped that they will avail themselves of the golden opportunity.
