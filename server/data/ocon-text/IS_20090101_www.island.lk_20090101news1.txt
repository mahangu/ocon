Kandy â€“ Export Development and International Trade Minister Professor G. L. Peiris is confident that the Central Provincial Council and North-Western Provincial Council Election would bring victory to the government.

"The people are supporting of the government and the government is stable. The people will back the government at the Provincial Councils Election," Prof. G. L. Peiris told the media after calling on the Most Venerable Mahanayake Theras of Malwatta and Asgiriya, on Tuesday (30).

Recalling the results of the last General Election, Prof. Peiris said the UPFA swept all the districts of the country.

If it was based on the electoral basis the UNP wouldn't have got a single seat. Under the proportional polls the UNP bagged many seats, Prof. Peiris said.

Responding to a query, Prof. Peiris said the UNP members who joined the government would not return to that party.

Of the 16 who joined only one returned, he added.

The government's position was stable and intact, therefore people had confidence in it, he said.
