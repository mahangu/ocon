The Island-NewsSome JVP top guns were in for a rude shock yesterday evening after the conclusion of their inaugural PC election rally in Kandy. A part of the platform they were on came crashing down. Some of them rolled down the steps while others simply landed on all fours.

JVP leader Somawansa Amerasinghe had just left the stage when the incident occurred.

Only JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva managed to avoid a pratfall. Party supporters rushed to their help and pandemonium reigned for a few minutes.

No one was injured. The JVP ruled out sabotage. (CW)
