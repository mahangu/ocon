I will not betray SLFP - Minister Anura Yapa

I would never betray the SLFP and President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Mass Media, Information and Enterprise Promotion Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said addressing a press conference at Kuliyapitiya yesterday.

The Minister said he would not leave a democratic leader like President Mahinda Rajapaksa and join any autocratic person.

As a senior Deputy Secretary of the SLFP his loyalty is to that party, he added.

Answering a question from a journalist, he said there was absolutely no truth in the rumour some parties had spread that he was quitting the SLFP and the government to support the Opposition candidate.
