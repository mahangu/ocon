Global economic crisis impacts on trade deficit

The trade deficit contracted for the 11th consecutive month in November 2009 by 24.4 per cent to US$ 251 million, largely due to the impact of the global economic crisis, the Central Bank said in a release. This reflected a 5.0 per cent decline in earnings from exports and 11.6 per cent reduction in expenditure on imports. On a year-on-year basis, cumulative earnings from exports and expenditure on imports declined by 14.7 per cent and 31.9 per cent respectively during the first eleven months of 2009.

Accordingly, the cumulative trade deficit decreased by 55.1 per cent to US$ 2,468 million during the first eleven months of 2009 from US$ 5,503 million in the corresponding period of 2008.

Despite the positive growth reported in agricultural and mineral exports, earnings from exports decreased in November 2009 mainly due to the decline in industrial exports. Agricultural exports recorded a positive year-on-year growth in November 2009, for the second consecutive month in 2009, led by tea exports, the bank said.

Expenditure on imports declined by a relatively lower rate in November 2009 with the positive growth of consumer good imports. Expenditure on consumer goods increased marginally in November, 2009 due to increased food imports. However, non-food consumer goods declined as in previous months, mainly due to lower imports of motor vehicles and electrical equipment. Expenditure on intermediate goods declined in November 2009, mainly due to the lower expenditure on fertilizer imports despite the increase in import volume. Investment goods imports also reported a year-on-year decline in November, 2009.

Despite the significant growth of transport equipment imports, all other subcategories of investment goods recorded negative growth, media release said.

The deficit in the trade account was off-set by the higher inflows of workers' remittances. During the first eleven months of 2009 workers' remittances increased by 14.2 per cent to US$ 3,035 million. As a result, workers' remittances were US$ 567 million (about 23 per cent) in excess of the trade deficit.

The gross official reserves, with and without Asian Clearing Union (ACU) funds, were at US$ 5,308 million and US$ 5,228 million, respectively, by end November 2009, This includes short-term net inflows to the Government Treasury bills of US$ 262 million and Treasury bonds of US$ 1,068 million. Based on the previous 12 months average imports (US$ 823 million per month), the gross official reserves, without ACU funds, were equivalent to 6.4 months of imports.
