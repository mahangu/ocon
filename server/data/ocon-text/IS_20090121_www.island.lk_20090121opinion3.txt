At present our Government is taking constructive steps to ease the global financial crisis faced by us.

The following steps have been taken since November 2008.

(1) Special reserve requirement by Commercial Banks with Central Bank has been reduced from 9.25% to 7.75% ie. Rs. 17 billion has been released with effect from 28 th November 2008 into the money market.

(2) Reverse Repurchase agreement rate has been reduced from 19% to 17% immediately. Therefore the cost of funds has been reduced by 2%.

Commercial banks in return can offer concessionary rates to their customers on lending.

It could be seen that more funds are available to customers at cheaper rates in the money market. The business community should communicate with their banks ensuring these benefits accrue to them.

We must utilize these concessionary offers by the government in the correct way.

I consider it necessary to mention here that in India, it is felt by economic experts that steps taken to control inflation may result in deflation by mid June 2009. More funds would be available with less demand. We may face a similar situation in Sri Lanka and should take necessary steps to avoid same.
