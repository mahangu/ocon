As soon as the army removes all landmines in the liberated areas, the construction of the villages will begin Media Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena told the media conference.

Minister Abeyawardena said that on a Government directive, Jaffna District Secretariat and Divisional Secretariats had selected 750-acres of land to set up three villages in the liberated areas of the North. All three villages would be named Suthanthiram (independence) liberation villages.
