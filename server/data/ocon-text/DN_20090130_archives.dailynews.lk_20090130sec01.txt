LTTE submarine found

The recovered LTTE submarine

An LTTE armour plated underwater craft and three other partially assembled submarine type smaller crafts (midgets) were recovered by the Task Force III troops from the Udayarkattukulam area in the recently liberated Vishuamadu last morning. The bigger craft was 35 feet in length, military sources said.

This was the most startling finding made by troops so far during the on going counter terrorist operations against the LTTE. The LTTE will be known as the first terrorist organisation to develop underwater weapons. It is the first terrorist outfit to introduce suicide bombers to the world and to develop naval and air arms.

The submarine like craft was found following the capture of a well designed Tiger camp spread out in 2 sq.km expanse. The camp consisted of 15 small houses and 5 billets, all tiled and airconditioned.

Among the items recovered were a large towing cradle with 13 wheels on one side, a Dvora type craft with a gun mount, a large number of out board motors, electric motors and water pumps, three paddle boats and machinery used in welding work.
