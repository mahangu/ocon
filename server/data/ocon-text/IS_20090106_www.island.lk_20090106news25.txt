The Island-NewsSapphires have been found near the surface at several places in the Hasalaka area. This has now become the newest attraction for treasure hunters!

The National Gem and Jewellery Authority has already taken steps to auction the lands for mining.

Hasalaka was at one time an established gem producing area. However, sapphires had not been known earlier.

The pits are relatively shallow, only 2 to 8 metres deep. For details of the auctions contact the Naula office of the NGJA on 0662246094.
