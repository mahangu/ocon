Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse NewspapersWelcome! New Year two thousand and nine 

 Bring with you the torch of peace to shine 

 Remove the darkness of violence and pain 

 There blooms real pleasures, that's certain Bar the horrible war and make all to hear 

 Peace is the road to prosperity and better future 

 Bury the gloomy worries, sorrows and fear 

 Raise the loving happiness, it's a great cheer. When I was going to write 

 a lovely stanza 

 I happened to write a lyrics about you 

 Little fingers were shivering 

 Steady heart was breaking 

 Blue eyes were tearing 

 The words were pleasant 

 The rhythm was fine 

 But I really don't know 

 Who are you? 

 Where are you? 

 Why do you come? 

 But I felt... 

 My life has changed 

 Because of this 

 strange lyrics 

 Are you a poem? 

 Either a verse or a free verse? 

 or a lengthy essay 

 which I am unable to finish 

 till my death.... I died.... 

 On the day my home phone died.... 

 It died.... 

 When my heart and soul died..... 

 Leaving me all alone in this world! 

 I died..... 

 The day I realised.... 

 I will never get a call ever.... 

 From my home phone... 

 Because..... 

 No one is at home to ring me... 

 In the day or night..... 

 Today, tomorrow...never again! 

 I was re-born... 

 The day I got a call.... 

 From my home phone..... 

 The happiest call... 

 I ever received in my life 

 It was from my home! 

 I started to live again.... 

 And my heart will beat 

 till my mobile rings.... 

 And 

 Indicates the number 

 Of my home phone! For the obligation on the rights of our nation, 

 carrying heavy cannons 

 Bleeding in the battle, 

 every moment, 

 standing against thousands of obstacles 

 and thousands of foes, 

 Sacrificing their thousands of aspirations 

 with holding their souls 

 towards the death in the rough hands of them. 

 Only for our nation.... 

 even only for harmony of the Future generation.... 

 endure and sweat, 

 among thousands of landmines 

 and thousands of firing guns 

 until acquiring a neosunrise for our Motherland. I convey my heartiest wish 

 to our unflinching warriors, you... 

 to come by an immortal victory soon 

 With the benisons of all our nation..
