Dismissing corruption charges against the government, non-Cabinet Minister Mervyn Silva has challenged General (Rtd) Sarath Fonseka's camp to prove at least one allegation ahead of the January 26 presidential elections.

Silva offered his Park Road residence to anyone, who could substantiate corruption charges against the Rajapaksas. Appearing on a live political talk show Rathu Ira (Red Line) this week on Swarnavahini, the National List MP told Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council Opposition Leader Ranjan Ramanayake that the UNP and its allies could move the judiciary against Ministers, Basil and Chamal and Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, though President Rajapaksa enjoyed immunity.

He said the UNP-JVP combine was bankrupt and could not even conduct a proper propaganda campaign. He said the Opposition was spreading lies. Mentioning several allegations levelled against the Rajapaksas relating to acquisition of property in Colombo, its suburbs and the provinces, he said that nothing could be as ridiculous as the allegation that the Rajapaksas had brought Swarnavahini. He challenged the Swarnavahini to respond to the Opposition allegation prompting the journalist conducting the programme to assure the public that there was absolutely no truth in the UNP claim. Speaking on behalf of the management, he said the station would never be sold to anyone. (SF)
