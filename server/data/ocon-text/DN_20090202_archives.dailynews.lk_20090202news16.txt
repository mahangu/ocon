Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse NewspapersHow green is my wallet? Organic food growth slows As recession drives consumers to cut costs, their commitment to organic food has been tested with sales growth slowing â€” but so far, sales are not falling. How green are our wallets? Grown without the use of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, organic food has been booming, driven by claims it is healthier, tastes better and its production does less damage to the environment than conventional agriculture. The global market for organic food and beverages was worth $22.75 billion in 2007, after more than doubling in five years, according to market research firm Euromonitor International. The United States accounted for about 45 percent of that total. With economies in crisis, the trend is slowing in the United States, Britain, France and Europe's most important market for organic food, Germany. So far, Britain is the market tipped for a fall as shrinking incomes force the newly green to save money. Typical growth rates of 20 to 30 percent for organic food sales in the United States eased in the second half of 2008 as middle- and upper-income families felt the strain of layoffs and declining investment portfolios, said Tom Pirovano, director of industry insights at market research firm The Nielsen Co. Sales in December were up 5.6 percent, year on year, against a 25.6 percent rise a year earlier.Even though growth is slowing, Pirovano noted that most people who purchased organic foods were very committed. "I'm not convinced that we are going to see big declines in organics any time soon," he said. Nielsen data measures packaged foods with bar codes at many retail outlets. Discount retailer Wal-Mart does not participate in the market research. Late on a Friday in London's South Kensington, shoppers at the Whole Foods store owned by the U.S.-based organic and natural foods supermarket were sparse. REUTERS
