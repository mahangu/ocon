HONG KONG (AP) - Defending Australian Open champion Maria Sharapova has withdrawn from a Hong Kong exhibition tournament saying she is still recovering from a shoulder injury just weeks ahead of the first Grand Slam of the year.

The three-time Grand Slam winner started playing tennis again just over two weeks ago and isn't match fit, organizers of the Jan. 7-10 Hong Kong event said in a statement on their Web site Wednesday.

"I'm just not ready to play against the top-class competition in Hong Kong, although I remain hopeful for Australia where I'm the defending champion," the statement quoted Sharapova as saying.
