The Division III soccer championship organised and conducted by Football Federation of Sri Lanka will come to a close tomorrow when the final between Sri Lanka Navy and Old Mazenodian takes place at CR & FC ground at 3.30 p.m. Both teams will be promoted to Division II for the next season.

Sri Lanka Navy soccerites have come to the final with a clean record making seven victories. To gain these seven wins their strikers have performed well scoring as many as 29 goals while giving away only one goal.

In the meantime Old Mazenodians from Kandana too are with a pleasing record though they don't have a huge number of goals under their belt. They have been able to collect only 19 goals from the same number of matches as the sailors, but they have given away eight goals.

If the mazenodians are to pose a big threat their strikers must penetrate the defence line of sailors at every given moment and reach the right target to move ahead. At the same time the Kandana defenders will have to come out with everything they have in store to halt the goal hungry sailors from scoring.

The winners are to receive the champions Trophy and a cash award of Rs. 100,000 while the losers collect a purse worth Rs. 50,000. With both teams equally balanced a good game soccer is expected from both teams.
