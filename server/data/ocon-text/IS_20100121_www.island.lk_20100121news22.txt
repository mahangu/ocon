The Government Nursing Officers' Association warned they would stage a protest campaign on February 17 over six demands they have placed before the Government. GNOA President, Saman Ratnapriya said yesterday (20) that the Union had postponed trade union action due to next week's Presidential election.

Ratnapriya warned that the GNOA would stage a protest on February 17 and would follow it up with a one day token strike on February 24 in hospitals island-wide.

The GNOA demands include a salary structure in accordance with the profession, to have five working days a week, revising the recruitment process, a four year nursing degree course, granting of three thousand rupees additional allowance and to initiate the grade one promotions on completion of eleven years of service.

Ratnapriya said the nurses had staged several protest campaigns (December 30, 2009 and January 6) at fifteen hospitals including the National Hospital, Karapitiya, Kandy and Jaffna Teaching Hospitals. The GNOA had protested opposite the Health Ministry and held a protest march in Colombo a week ago to force the government to take note of the long overdue demands, he said.
