Pledges

* I will not allow repetition of 1988-90 violence

* I will not allow division of country

* All must unite to develop country

"We remember the evil killings of that period well," President Rajapaksa said addressing a mass rally held at Sanath Jayasuriya Stadium, Matara yesterday.

The President said he would neither allow a repetition of violence nor a division of the country.

President Rajapaksa said as he united the divided country, he will continue the economic development of the country exactly as he had done during the past four years.

Over 100,000 people attended the Presidential Election rally at the Sanath Jayasuriya stadium. President Rajapaksa said the Opposition was engaged in a vilification campaign as usual but he will not betray the trust that people continued to repose in him.

There were rumour mongers and he would not be surprised if they said that he too crossed over to the Opposition the next day. Therefore the public should be wary of such rumour mongers.

The time has come for all groups of people to forget party or colour difference and unite to develop the country, he said.

The President said he would implement all policies pledged in the Mahinda Chintana policy program from January 27 itself just as he fulfilled the pledge to liberate the country from the LTTE terrorist group.
