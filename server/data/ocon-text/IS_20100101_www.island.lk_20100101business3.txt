BANGKOK (AP) â€” Oil prices headed toward $80 a barrel yesterday in Asia, the final day of trading for 2009, after US crude stockpiles fell for the fourth week in a row.

Benchmark crude for February delivery was up 28 cents at $79.56 a barrel at late morning Bangkok time in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract added 41 cents to settle at $79.28 on Wednesday.

The Energy Information Administration said US crude supplies shrank by 1.5 million barrels last week, less than the expected drop of 2.2 million barrels. Gasoline supplies also fell.
