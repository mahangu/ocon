The largest Neuro-trauma Unit with a 300 bed capacity, constructed at a cost of Rs.5,000 million, was installed in the Colombo National Hospital to be commissioned shortly.

This new unit will be able to cater to the needs of patients of various categories. Victims of accidents, attempted suicides, victims of lightning, burn injuries, domestic violence and similar mishaps could be treated at this unit.

The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has provided the funds to construct the new unit and Healthcare Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva has instructed National hospital Director Hector Weerasinghe to admit the injured war heroes to the unit who require timely medical attention, Health Ministry said.

The Minister who visited the Neuro-trauma unit on an observation tour told The Island that due to congestion at the Accident Ward in Colombo many patients were unable to get timely medical attention, but in future patients and accident victims who require immediate and timely medical attention could be admitted to the new unit and get treatment under trained medical and nursing staff.

He said the unit has been installed with highly sophisticated, life saving medical equipment.

He further said, the Health Ministry said the new Neuro-trauma unit would be able to provide a better medical service to people. The two neurologists attached to the Colombo National hospital would be detailed to the new unit. National Hospital Director Hector Weerasinghe had ensured that adequate nursing and paramedical staff would be appointed to the unit.
