President Mahinda Rajapaksa's government has earmarked $4 billion to rebuild the war-shattered north, President Mahinda Rajapaksa said yesterday.

The $4 billion is a mix of government and donor funds and would be spent in 2010 to rebuild railroads, power generation and irrigation infrastructure, he told foreign correspondents at a meeting at his official residence.

"We have already signed $3 billion within the next three years for Eastern development," he said, referring to the areas the government liberated in 2007.

Asked if there was any chance that LTTE supporters could regroup, the President said the group was defeated militarily, but acknowledged that Tamil concerns about marginalisation had to be met to eliminate any chance of renewed violence. "There are sympathisers, but that depends on how the government takes care of the issue," Rajapaksa said.

Rajapaksa has pledged to hold provincial elections in the North soon after the general election.
