A married couple was arrested by Narcotics Bureau sleuths yesterday at Kalubowila with nearly ten kilos of heroin valued at Rs 70 million rupees.

Investigations have revealed that the woman is a Maldivian national who arrived in Sri Lanka in 2007 and married a Sri Lankan. They lived in a luxury house paying a monthly rent of Rs 45,000.

A Pakistani national was in the habit of visiting the couple and it is suspected that he had been smuggling heroin from Pakistan and supplying the suspects. The couple in turn had retailed it through a motor cyclist, who was also arrested. Interpol has been requested to help trace the Pakistani national.
