British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has made a strong case for honouring cricket legends such as India batsman Sachin Tendulkar with a knighthood.

Brown, currently on tour in India looking to strengthen ties between the two countries, believes the Indian masterblaster should be rewarded for his contribution to the game.

"Sachin is one of the great cricketers in the world. It's not for me to decide honours in our country. It is a matter for an independent honours committee," Brown said.

"But I'm sure the people recognise that just like Sir Don Bradman and others who were awarded honours as honorary knighthood for the work they did for cricket, there is of course a strong case for reward."

Tendulkar, currently on tour in Australia, made his debut in 1989 and has so far scored 11,616 runs in 145 Tests with a world-record 38 centuries.
