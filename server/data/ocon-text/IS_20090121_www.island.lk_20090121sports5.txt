MANCHESTER, England (AP) - Brazil star Robinho left Manchester City's training camp without permission just as his compatriot, Kaka, rejected a world-record bid to join him at the Premier League club.

The 24-year-old Robinho walked out of the training camp in Tenerife and has reportedly returned to Brazil.

"I do know Robinho is not at the training center in Tenerife," executive chairman Garry Cook said Tuesday. "If he has left the training ground it is a breach of club discipline. I am waiting for a full debrief."

City stunned the football world when it beat out Chelsea to sign Robinho in the final minutes of the transfer window in September, paying Real Madrid a British record transfer fee of 32.5 million pounds (then $51million; euro40 million).

While he has scored 12 goals for the club, City is still in the bottom half of the table just four points above the relegation zone.

Robinho has notbeen afraid to criticize his teammates in public or advise manager Mark Hughes about who he should be signing.

"They are content with just finishing fifth or sixth," Robinho said last month. "They are content with little, thinking just a draw might be good enough. They lack the mentality of champions. I have learned that being second is worthless so I want to inspire a winning mentality."

Since those comments at the start of December, City has picked up just eight points from a possible 18 in the league - prompting the team to pursue new players in the January transfer window.

AC Milan star Kaka topped that list and City pursued him in a blaze of publicity to help Sheik Mansour's Abu Dhabi United Group achieve its ambition of turning City into a global force.

City was offering around 100 million pounds in an audacious attempt to lure Kaka away from the 2007 Champions League winner to a club without a major trophy since 1976.
