This is a period where the cost of living is soaring, but some crackpot had decreed the fish market to be closed on poya days. A huge handbill to this effect has been displayed around the Pettah fish market. It is stated that this has been authorized by the Chief Municipal Veterinary Surgeon (C.M.V.S.)

Most of the middle class people visit the fish market on government holidays to purchase their weekly supply of fish, because it is cheaper than the other private fish stalls that have come up all over the city. These stalls sell fish at exorbitant rates. This also includes the supermarkets which are patronised by the wealthy.

It is the people who survive on a hand to mouth basis who are deprived as a result.

Even purchasing fish at St. John's market has become extremely hazardous, as it is evident that even the steps are used for the unauthorised sale of fish.

Is it possible that the Jathika Hela Urumaya has influenced this impractical course of action.?

If so why has the government permitted the sale of fish in the luxurious supermarkets patronised by the wealthy? These luxurious supermarkets too should be closed on poya days. On the other hand, have the U.N.P. activists in the fishmarket created a situation at this time to discredit the government?

The crackpot who has authorized this could be a staunch U.N.Per who is trying to put his two cents worth of his scheme to show some higherup in his setup that he has done his two cents worth to discredit the government.

If luxurious supermarkets who sell besides fish, pork and sausages as well, are permitted to sell these items on poya days then why close the only fish market from where we obtain our fish supplies at relatively cheaper rates, on poya days.?
