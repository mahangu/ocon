St. Peter's College savoured the joy of producing four players for the Sri Lanka Under-19 team for the World Cup, while for that very reason it held them back from doing well against some of their opponents in tough third term matches in the on-going Under-19 tournament.

After losing outright to Dharmapala College, Pannipitiya and a first innings defeat at the hands of Isipatana in the third term, the young Petes are fighting back in the first term and are showing that they are a formidable side, even without their top players.

With skipper Chathura Peiris, deputy skipper Akshu Fernando, wicket keeper batsman Andri Berenger and their new recruit, Lahiru Jayaratne, being called for National duty, St. Peter's College did not have their best team for a better part of their third term fixtures. They will not be available until the ICC Youth World Cup ends on January 30 in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Their absence was felt to a great extent when Dharmapala handed them an outright defeat, but from then on their young cricketers have been fighting their way back.

The youngsters who were given opportunities in the absence of the seniors grabbed them with both hands and there is hardly anyone who has failed. Continuing in the first term still without their seniors, the Peterites did well against Ananda and St. Benedict's.

Denham Perera and Angelo Emmanuel, who shared the acting captain role, were equal to their tasks. Left hander Emmanuel has a century and 96 runs and has a five wicket haul. Denham Perera was involved in a marathon innings last week when he scored a massive 170 runs. He also has a half century to his credit.

All rounders Sampath Kumara and Nilochana Perera too have had a good tournament. Nilochana has two good knocks under his belt. An unbeaten century and an unbeaten half century places him among the top scorers in the team. Kumara has an unbeaten half century.
