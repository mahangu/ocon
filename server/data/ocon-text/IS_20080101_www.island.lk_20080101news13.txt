Political Parties are surprised that despite the Government's announcing that fresh nominations would be received, between January 14 and 21 for the oft postponed Elections to nine local bodies in the Batticaloa District, no arrangements had been made, up to yesterday, by the Elections Secretariat to prepare for it, political sources said yesterday.

The Assistant Commissioner of Elections for the Batticaloa District T. Krishnanandalingam was not available for comment but a spokesperson said that they had received no intimation from the Commissioner of Elections Dayananda Dissanayake's office either in writing or verbally.

"Up to now we have only heard of it over the radio and through the newspapers. "We have not made any preparations at all for such polls, but in 2006 we made preparations for elections according to the Electoral Register for 2004 and if we are to hold it in the current year, it would have to be held according to the Register of 2006, he said"

Meanwhile, EPDP Leader and Minister Douglas Devananda told The Island" that he had invited the TMVP (Pillayan Faction), PLOTE Leader Dharmalingam Siddharthan and the EPRLF (Varadha Faction) and a consensus has been reached after discussions to contest the local elections in the Batticaloa District under a single banner.

"Now, we have to hold discussions with another two to three factions, excluding Karuna's of the TMVP, before deciding on the number of slots each of us would have in fielding candidates."

Additional Commissioner of Elections (Provincial and Local) P. M. Sumanasiri said that the notification calling for nominations would be Gazzetted on January 4 and the date for the nominations would be set in accordance to the Local government Elections Act.

The Local Elections are to be held for the Batticaloa MC, Manmunai PS, Manmunai South â€“ West PS, Manmunai South and Eruvil Pattru PS, Eravur Pattru, Manmunai west PS, Korale Pattru PS and Korale Pattru West PS.
