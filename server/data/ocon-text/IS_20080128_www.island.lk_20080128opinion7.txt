The Sri Lanka Telecom has so far not responded to the many articles that appeared in your esteemed journal challenging the new tariff scheme (from 1st November 2007) which they claim would reduce the charged by 8.7%)

It is the responsibility of the SLT to prove to the Supreme court and the General public that the revised tariff results in a reduction of 8.7%. The best way to prove their bona fides is to indicate in the monthly bills what the charge would have been under the old tariff. It will be sufficient if this is done only for 3 months.

In this electronic era, such information can be provided without any difficulty and at no extra cost.
