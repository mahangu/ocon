'Last year most significant in post independence history'

The last year was the most significant year for Sri Lanka during the post independence history in many ways, said Sri Lankan High Commissioner in Malaysia Dr D. D. Ranasinghe.

The Sri Lanka High Commission in Malaysia organized an official ceremony to mark the dawn of 2010 at the High Commission premises in Kuala Lumpur.

The High Commissioner said the most important milestone was the defeating and elimination of the LTTE terrorism which caused a severe damage to the country during the last three decades. In achieving this victory over LTTE, which was described as an invincible force, the leadership provided by President Mahinda Rajapaksa was immeasurable.

The people witnessed how the President faced numerous challenges that he had to face from domestic and international fronts. If not for his determination and the leadership, the victory over LTTE would never have been possible.

Year 2010 will be yet another year full of challenges and responsibilities for all Sri Lankans to take forward the development plans initiated by the Government.
