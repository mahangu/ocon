The Island-NewsThe two PS members, Amila Nuwan (UNP) and Premalal Abeysekara (UPFA) of the Bope-Poddala Pradeshiya Sabha jumped onto the tables, during the monthly meeting of the Sabha on Tuesday (30), in protest against the failure of the local authority to clear the garbage collected in the drains leading to the Gintota area.

The meeting was presided over by Chairman Padmasena Mawella Vithange.

The protest continued for nearly ten minutes but the two members occupied their chairs afterwards complaining that the drains had not been cleared in spite of their repeated requests over several monhs.
