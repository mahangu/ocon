The Island-OpinionThis is a New Year Greeting Card I received. At first I thought it was a joke but later I realised that it was a sincere and genuine wish. Don't we believe that the devil brings all evil? If so, is it not correct or should we not wish to appeal to the devil to save us from evil and disasters?

In Sri Lanka don't we have 'Thovil' and offer 'Pideni' 'Dola' to 'Yakkas' to save us from all evil? Time has come for us to revive our proven age old rituals.
