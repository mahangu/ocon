I was shocked reading the story in a Sunday newspaper of how a former Sri Lankan Ambassador in Italy had abandoned his dog named Lucky, leaving it behind in his official residence when he returned to Sri Lanka in June 2007.

It was said the dog was found chained and without food and water after the Ambassador had left the residence. I was relieved the story ended happily, with Lucky being adopted by a loving family, thanks to the joint efforts of a local animal welfare organization and an animal rights activist in London..

Although the incident happened two years ago, we are thankful for the exposure given to by this newspaper because, perhaps it could help in preventing other Sri Lankan diplomats from treating their pets in the same manner. It is indeed an inhumane, anti social and a shameful act for anybody to abandon an animal taken into one's care, and it is indeed unthinkable that an ambassador, whose conduct is supposed to be impeccable at all times, should resort to such a shameful act, inviting disgrace on his country.

We have written to the Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting him to inquire into this matter and advise all Sri Lankan Ambassadors, diplomats and those in the Foreign Service to ensure that pet animals kept by them in their residences should be treated humanely at all times. In the event of the Ambassadors or any other others in the Foreign Service leaving the country to return home or take up a posting in another country, they should consider it their moral obligation to take their pets along with them, unless they are able to find a suitable and caring home for the pets.

Diplomats should be reminded that the decision to have a pet animal while serving in a foreign country should be taken with responsibility and there is no diplomatic immunity where moral obligations are concerned.
