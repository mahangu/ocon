As an ordinary citizen not linked to the medical profession I am inclined to agree with the comments of Dr. Athukorale and D. G. Dassanayaka of Dodangoda on the subject of generic drugs and brand drugs. However I believe that there are two sides to this issue. I may be wrong. One is that some doctors recommend expensive brand drugs because they are aware of the high quality of such medicines and genuinely wish speedy recovery for their patients. The other is that there are unscrupulous physicians in the pay of the drug mafia. Why they recommend expensive drugs manufactured by these drug companies is obvious. Although drugs in Dr. Senaka Bibile's list may be by now outdated we cannot and should not ever forget the campaign he spearheaded on behalf of Third World countries and less affluent patients. In such a context what choice is there for the poor if State institutions like the Osu Sala today sell poor quality drugs? The remedy I think is - as Dassanayake suggests - is a method to test and compare the different strengths of brand drugs and generic drugs if there is no such mechanism in place yet.
