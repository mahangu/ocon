The police yesterday fired tear gas to disperse supporters of the ruling UPFA and the joint Opposition after clashes erupted at Kiribathgoda town.

Both parties accused each other of launching attacks with the police blaming government and Opposition supporters of going on the rampage. The UNP and the JVP said that UPFA thugs had targeted their supporters who were engaged in a propaganda campaign at Kiribathgoda in support of common presidential candidate Sarath Fonseka.

"They threw stones at our supporters," George Perera, UNP organizer for Gampaha District told The Island. He said that the government should be ashamed of unleashing thugs on its political rivals though the President had assured the forthcoming presidential polls would be conducted in a peaceful manner.

At the time violent clashes erupted there had been several UNP organizers, including Suranimala Rajapaksa, Ruwan Wijewardene, John Amaratunga and Varunadeepthi Rajapaksa, a JVP councilor.

Sarath Dias, Chairman, Kelaniya Pradeshiya Sabha, told The Island that the police directed tear gas at UPFA supporters. He said that they had been attacked by Opposition supporters, though an attempt was being made to blame them. According to him, they, too, were campaigning at Kiribathgoda at that time.

Several vehicles and shops were damaged during yesterday's mini battle.
