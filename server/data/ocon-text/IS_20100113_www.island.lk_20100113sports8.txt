Tillakaratne Dilshan is not a product of an elite school in the big city, much like the 'Matara Mauler' Sanath.

He hit the limelight, in international cricket.

Two years ago, Dilshan's presence in the National squad, as a middle order batsman, was not secure. Against this backdrop, the selectors quite wisely opted to try him out as an opener, to which he responded in a positive manner. His recent phenomenal success in that capacity, in 2009, tells the story.

With the dashing Sanath in the twilight of his career, having lost the magic of the willow and with age telling on him, the mantle as opener fell on the shoulders of Dilshan.

Today, he is the bane of the pace bowlers in world cricket, much like India's Virender Sehwag and West Indies skipper Chris Gayle.

The year 2009 saw him on the crest of a wave of success. He scored 1071 Test runs at 64.52 and 1000 in one dayers at 55.55 and 471, in T20s at 42.81, achieved in a swashbuckling manner. His remarkable performance with the willow places him high on the ladder for the International Cricketer of the Year award.

Dilshan and Upul Tharanga have proved their potental as openers and the selectors should persist with them.

Tharanga has certainly cemented his place as an opener. His consistency with the bat, in the on-going Tri-Series in Dhaka for the Idea Cup is a case in point.

This combination should hold good till the 2011 World Cup.

Quality openers play a vital role. If you turn back the pages of cricketing history, we come across pairs of brilliant openers, such as Woodfull and Ponsford, Arthur Morris and Sid Barnes of Australia, Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook of England and Gordon Greenidge and Desmond Haynes of the West Indies to name a few. They have often given their teams flying starts, so that the top order batsmen could deliver the goods, based on the sound foundation laid by the openers. This vital aspect in batting should be food for thought for the selectors.
