How to vote

There were several callers to our desk wanting to clear doubts as to the manner of voting.

The practice is the same as in all previous elections. A vote is signified by the digit 1 or a simple cross or any other mark so that the voter's intention is expressed by the mark and this constitutes a valid vote.

In addition the voter if he/she so desires can mark a second preference with the digit 2 and if further inclined a third preference by writing the digit 3 in the relevant cage.

However, if the voter has not marked his/her vote (that is with digit 1 or the cross as the case may be) it will be deemed an invalid vote. By the same token if only Preferences (2, or 3 as the case may be) are marked it too constitutes an invalid vote.
