COYLE delegation visits Indonesia

Chamber of Young Lankan Entrepreneurs (COYLE) recently organized a trade delegation of young entrepreneurs to Indonesia to promote trade and investment opportunities among the counterparts in Sri Lanka and Indonesia.

The delegates had a series of very successful meetings with representatives of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN), in Jakarta, Indonesia.

They are hopeful that this will lead to establish significant business relationships between COYLE members and Indonesian counterparts.
