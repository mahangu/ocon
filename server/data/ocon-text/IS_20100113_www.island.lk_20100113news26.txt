The Leader of the SLFP-M, Mangala Samaraweera, said yesterday that he was very much involved in General Sarath Fonseka's Presidential Election campaign, contrary to rumours being spread by the Rajapaksa regime.

Samaraweera told a news conference in Colombo that the government, knowing very well that it was heading for defeat at this month's Presidential Election, has alleged that he no longer addresses General Fonseka's meetings. But, this was far from the truth.

"I have addressed many meetings along with General Fonseka. But it cannot be done continuously because I need to look after my electorate as well. Over the last two days, I addressed 55 pocket meetings in Matara, in support of General Fonseka. I want to obtain the highest number of votes for him from Matara."

Samaraweera said that the Rajapaksa regime was spreading another canard, that he was opposed to the 'Fonseka-TNA Pact', allegedly signed at the residence of UNP MP, Ravi Karunanayake. "For me to be opposed, there has to be a pact in the first place. No such thing took place. General Fonseka, we believe is a man of his word. All political parties, including the TNA, are backing him on trust and not based on any written agreement. The TNA, has only endorsed the ten point plan presented by General Fonseka to restore democracy, establish good governance and eradicate nepotism and rampant corruption."

President Rajapaksa was accusing Fonseka of being pro-LTTE. But, this was after he failed to secure the TNA's support, despite offering them three Cabinet portfolios and even money, he alleged.

Samaraweera said that the TNA comprises some senior and respected Tamil political leaders such as R. Sambandan, Mavai Senathiraja and Suresh Premachandran. But the government continues to play the same old record, even after the LTTE has been defeated.
