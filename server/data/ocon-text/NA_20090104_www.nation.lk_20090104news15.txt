 Due to the inability to face the competition with the other armed forces, the Police Department has taken steps to downgrade entry requirements for their enlistments. 



 Previously, six passes at the G.C.E. O/L examination including Mathematics, Sinhala, Tamil, English in the first sitting was required as educational qualifications to join the Police Service. 

 But, the recent alterations permit candidates who fulfil the above mentioned requirements in not more than two sittings eligible to apply for the Police Service. 



 "A minor alteration has been made regarding the educational qualifications in the entry requirements," explained Police Spokesman SSP Ranjith Gunasekara. 



 "We had to take this step due to the massive competition that has been created while recruiting the youth as they are more interested in joining the Army, Navy and Air Force," SSP Gunasekara pointed out. 

 He also added that 1,000 recruitments were already made about two months back and they are now undergoing training. The Police had earlier reported that they have plans to recruit 10,000 youth to the force.
