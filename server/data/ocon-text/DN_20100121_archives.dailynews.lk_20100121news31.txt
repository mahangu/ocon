It was President's leadership that won war - Gammanpila

When General Denzil Kobbekaduwa's successful operation was going on against the LTTE terrorists at Wadamarachchi, India dropped packages of food over the North. Kobbekaduwa was asked to stop the operation by President J.R.Jayewardene under India's pressure. Did Sarath Fonseka then a Colonel under Kobbekaduwa refuse to turn back and continue the attack on the terrorists? Western Provincial Council Minister Udaya Gammanpila queried yesterday.

Addressing a UPFA press conference at the Mahaveli Centre Gammanpila said during 2002, Sarath Fonseka then a Major General was the Northern Commandant. When Ranil Wickremesinghe asked the army to dismantle the High Security Zones, Fonseka obeyed him like a lamb. I am not saying this on my own but it is clearly written in the book My Belly is White by former Defence Secretary Austin Fernando, he said.

Fonseka should know that it was the political leadership of President Mahinda Rajapaksa that succeeded in winning the war against the terrorists as President Rajapaksa did not bow before external pressure to stop the military operations against the terrorists.

The President provided the armed forces with all the weapons and equipment and strengthened them, he also said.

He said the Tamil National Alliance had said the presidential election was a contest among the Sinhala people to select the hero of the war but sometime later on January 2 they told the media they had some conditions to put forward to the two candidates.
