The Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission (SLMM) scheduled to leave today after six years in the war affected North and East, said yesterday (16) their task had been a very difficult but they had acted without bias contrary to accusations from the government and the LTTEto that effect.Asked to comment on the proposal for a UN mediation or intervention in the armed conflict in Sri Lanka, head of SLMM Johann Solberg said he could not answer a political question. He however said the armed conflict would not be a solution to the problem.

Both, the Government and the LTTE, should go for a negotiated political solution, he said. Solberg said he could not give an accurate figure of CFA violations by the LTTE or the government though some government estimates had put the number of violations as high as 8,000. They were in the process of finalizing their report that would give the figures according to the information they had gathered at the ground level.He said it was sad to find the CFA being violated more from the end of 2006 and gradually it was becoming clear that the conflict was worsening, but the SLMM's role became more and more difficult as the clashes were escalating.

Asked whether the SLMM role in monitoring the CFA achieved any positive result Solberg said their experience in the affected areas will be given in their final report and it could become useful for other organizations and concerned persons to learn from the SLMM experience.

When questioned about the final date on which the LTTE had reported a CFA violation by the security forces he said that the final report that they intend to submit will give all the details they had but the escalation of the conflict at a larger scale had sometimes made it difficult to track all the incidents accurately.

The SLMM leaves the country today as their role ends with the abrogation of the CFA signed on February 21, 2002 between then Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe and LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran
