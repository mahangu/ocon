NEW DELHI: Holding candles and banners, a group of cricketers, including four Test players from the Capital, led a protest demonstration at the Ferozeshah Kotla, which houses the offices of the Delhi and District Cricket Association.

Madan Lal, Kirti Azad, Vivek Razdan and Robin Singh (Jr) were the Test players who made it on Wednesday even though many had promised to join the crusade against corruption in the DDCA.

The protest was against the DDCA's failure to run cricket affairs efficiently. "Also against nepotism and corruption," said Madan Lal.

"The latest episode ending in the India-Sri Lanka one-day match being abandoned has once again brought the cricketers together and put the DDCA in a 'tight spot'," Azad observed.

A few club cricketers were also asked to join this protest. "Some have come on their own and it only goes to show how frustrated the cricketers are in Delhi. There is no cricket culture and we have become a laughing stock all over the world," said Azad.

"There is an urgent need to provide the cricketers with a clean atmosphere. How have things been allowed to drift to such an extent? The image of DDCA is at its lowest," added Madan.

Raghuvir Saini, a veteran first-class cricketer, was among those who gathered on a cold evening. "Nothing has changed," said the former wicketkeeper even as word came in that Bishan Singh Bedi was stuck in a traffic mess and would not be able to make it to the Kotla.

The protest against DDCA was to continue on Thursday with some more players promising to join the "crusade."
