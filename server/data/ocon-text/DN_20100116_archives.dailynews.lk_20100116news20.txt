Sanjeevi JAYASURIYA

The environment impact will be embedded in the school curricula as basic principle of sustainable living in a bid to educate students to protect environment. The Think Green initiative of EDEX is exemplary to all Sri Lankans and this concept will truly educate, engage and activate our youth towards sustainable living, Education Minister Susil Premjayantha said at the opening of EDEX 2010 at BMICH yesterday.

The EDEX exhibition has been keeping pace with changing technologies providing knowledge not only for students and parents, but even for teachers on the numerous avenues that are available to pursue higher studies with a career path suiting their skills, he said.

This is the seventh consecutive year the National Higher Education and Careers Exhibition EDEX was conducted taking the challenges of providing the youth a path to realize their true potential and drive the country to 21st century. With the dawn of peace in the country and from the contribution of educated and skilled youth, we can now usher an era of economic prosperity to the motherland.

The Government's desire is to spearhead future development activities based on a knowledge society. The, EDEX's effort to make the youth aware of contribution to the nation's development is highly commendable, he said. The spectrum of education is constantly changing. Computers have replaced the use of printed books. Many international companies have launched hand held e-book readers. Students too will be using such technology for education soon.

I also envision that the youth will also contribute to the development of technology and an event such as EDEX will give the youth initial boost, he said.
