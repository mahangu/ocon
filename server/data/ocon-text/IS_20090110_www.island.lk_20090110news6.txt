Pandemonium reigned in Parliament yesterday as Leader of the House Nimal Siripala de Silva said that the No-confidence motion by the UNP had lapsed just as UNP MPs trooped in wearing red and black coloured saatakas (shawls) round their necks accusing the Government of killing Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickramatunge.

The House was in turmoil for nearly 45 minutes.

UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe followed with a muffler wrapped round his face fully covering the mouth and nose which prompted Power Minister Mahindanada Aluthgamage to urge somebody to go to Ranil Wckremesinghe's rescue or he was choked to death.

"This must be a conspiracy by S. B. Dissanayake to silence our Opposition leader since SB knows that the leader could serve the party better when he does not speak," Aluthgamage chipped.

Another group of UNP MPs carrying placards got up from their seats and sat in the Well of the House shouting slogans to the effect "Satakaya Gaathakaya", "Sirasata Gehuwe Aanduwai" and "Lasantha Meruwe Aanduwai" They had the same slogans written on the placards they were carrying.

The JVP and the Tamil National Alliance MPs were present but were mere spectators and did not utter a word. SLFP (M) sole member Mangala Samaraweera did not attend yesterday's sittings.

In the midst of the melee, the oral questions were also asked and answers provided.

At the end of the question and answer sessions, Speaker W. J. M. Lokubandara invited UNP MP Dayasiri Jayasekera to move the no-fath motion. At this juncture Chief Opposition Whip Joseph Michael Perera said that the motion would not be moved against the Government.

At this Leader of the House Nimal Siripala de Silva said that if the Opposition failed to move the motion it would stand lapsed. "The Opposition is running scared of another humiliating defeat. They are scared" Government MPs shouted in chorus.
