Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse NewspapersEast West Marketing "A" and Sampath Bank "A" will clash in the 16th annual Singer MCA Premier League Knock out cricket tournament final today at the P. Saravanamuttu Stadium, commencing at 10.00 am.

In the semifinals, East West Marketing "A" scored a convincing six wicket win over HNB "A" while Sampath Bank "A" earned a hard fought three wicket win over the defending champions, F and G Fingara. The final will be of great significance as their league match did not materialize on 10th February at the CCC grounds due to the officiating umpires from the ACU, failing to turn up at the grounds.

East West Marketing will be captained by the experienced, Jeewantha Kulathunga of Colts CC fame and Sampath Bank "A" will be led by Sri Lanka's versatile middle order batsman Thilina Kandamby.

Jeewantha Kulatunga's target will be to bring home the double for East West as they have already clinched the League title. Only two teams have achieved this feat so far, HNB in 2002 and Sampath Bank in 2007.

In the 2007 final played at the same venue, Sampath Bank "A" led by Jeevan Mendis beat East West Marketing "A" by 104 runs. In last year's final played at the Colts Grounds, Ceylinco SC "A" (Fingara) beat Sampath Bank "A" by two wickets.

Sampath Bank "A" won the league title in 2007 in which year they scored a double, winning the Knock-out, too. In the quarter finals, East West Marketing "A" scored a comfortable six wickets win over the league wooden spoonist, Ceylinco SC "A" while Sampath Bank "A" beat John Keells "A" by 37 runs.

The awards presentation for both segments of the tournament will take place after the knock out final.
