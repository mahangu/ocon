The National Transport Commission (NTC) has imposed new conditions on 3,300 new long-distance private buses. The rationale for this is that almost all long-distance-running buses lack a number of transport facilities, services and often cause numerous problems to passengers.

Bus owners who do not comply with the NTC's new set of rules are liable to be prosecuted in accordance with the Road Passenger Transport Act, Transport Minister Dallas Alahapperuma told a media conference at the Ministry auditorium yesterday.

Alahapperuma said a majority of long-distance buses did not have basic first aid facilities and safety devices for the protection of the commuters. Display of accurate time tables recommended by the NTC should be fixed for the perusal of passengers when necessary, while stickers should not be affixed to glasses inside buses. The NTC has received a large number of complaints of noise pollution as bus crew were in the habit of playing disco music in full volume inside buses converting the bus into a record bar.

According to Alahapperuma, the new rules would ban loud music being played inside buses, but radios would be allowed. Doors should always be kept closed except when entering and exiting. A list of the bus fares recommended by the NTC should be displayed inside buses. The sound limits of a semi-luxury bus would be 85 discible, and 80 discible for luxury buses. The sound out put of the silencer should not be above discible 88, while the sound of the horn should be 105 discible, he said.

When asked about the non-issuance of tickets, Minister Alahapperuma said that with effect from April 2008, all private bus owners would be required to purchase ticketing machines. A sound management system for the buses could be created with the application of ticketing machines. The data of buses required by the NTC could be obtained accurately, precise information on income could also be obtained.
