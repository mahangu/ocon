I have been intrigued by the yards of space you have 'dedicated' to the repartee [schoolboyish] and virility [self-proclaimed] of that rather mediocre PM John K Allow me to refer to two facts that his cheer leaders have missed.

[1] When he returned from Bandung, he was lionised by Lake House as "Bandung Veeraya" [hero]. Not long after he visited Delft island, famous for its ponies with whom he was photographed. A witty Sinhala pamphleteer immediately labelled him "Bandung Booruwa"[ass], which rhyming nickname he carried to his downfall in 1956.

[2] Fairly soon after his defeat, John K decided to write an autobiography to ensure his place in history. This was ghost written by the same hand responsible for the anti-Dudley diatribe 'The Premier Stakes'. This 'masterpiece' was titled "An Asian Prime Minister's Story". What is most interesting is that in 'his' final paragraph, he proclaims his intention to donate his Kandawela property to a boy's orphanage on the lines of England's Barnardo Homes! It is obvious he changed his mind and his will since this rash offer.
