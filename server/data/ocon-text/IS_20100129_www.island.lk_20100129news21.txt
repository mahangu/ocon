by Dilanthi Jayamanne

The Professions Suplementary to Medicine (PSM) urged newly elected President, Mahinda Rajapaksa to appoint a Health Secretary, to the Health Ministry, who is able to deal with all health services equally. It would be advisable to appoint a Health Secretary immediately rather than appointing someone to temporarily act in his capacity.

PSM President, Ravi Kumudesh said yesterday (28) that they would be addressing President Rajapaksa in this regard. There was no point in appointing an Acting Health Secretary and leaving the actual position vacant for several months. He said Retired. Health Secretary Dr. Athula Kahandaliyanage had been able to carry out his duties maintaining a good rapport with all health sector workers.

"The Health service comprises not only the doctors. There is more to it than that," Kumudesh said. The person appointed to a position should be one who can understand the issues and problems faced by all health sector workers. A large number of health officials are doctors and they are able to tackle the issues faced by medical officers. A very few of the other services work in an official capacity at the Ministry, especially in the nursing and PSM capacities and

the Health Secretary should be able to oversee and attend to issues of these services as well, he said.
