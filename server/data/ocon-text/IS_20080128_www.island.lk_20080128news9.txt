A one-and-a-half-year old child choked to death on a piece of beef recently at Grandpass. It was revealed at the inquest conducted by City Coroner Edward Ahangama into the sudden death of Maduranga Prasad Jayasundara.

His father giving evidence said Prasad could not speak and had undergone surgery. On the day of the incident, all his three children had consumed beef. When Maduranga choked on a piece of meat, he had been rushed to the Lady Ridgeway Hospital, where he died.
