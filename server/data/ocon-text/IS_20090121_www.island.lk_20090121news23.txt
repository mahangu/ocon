The CID yesterday recorded statements of Ceylinco Consolidated Chairman Lalith Kotelawala and 10 other directors of the collapsed Golden Key Credit Card Company in connection with an alleged fraud at the company, police said.

Last week, the Mount Lavinia Chief Magistrate Harsha Setunga directed the CID to record their statements before January 20. Four persons including the company's Deputy Chairman Khavan Perera are in remand prison over the alleged fraud.
