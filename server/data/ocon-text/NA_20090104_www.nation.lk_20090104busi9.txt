Seven years after it commenced operations as Sri Lanka's centre of excellence for screening for many forms of cancer, the Ceylinco Healthcare centre says it has helped thousands of Sri Lankans protect themselves against the dreaded disease by opting for early detection.



 Now a well-known landmark on Park Street, Colombo 2, the Centre which celebrated its 7th anniversary this month said it was particularly pleased with the progress it had made in combating the spread of breast cancer, having performed nearly 9,000 mammograms over this period.



 Close to 26,000 people have visited the centre for screening over the past seven years, about 14,000 of them in the last three, the Centre's Senior Medical Officer Dr. Shyama Fernando disclosed this week. Some 275 people who tested positive for cancer have had or are undergoing treatment. To mark its 7th anniversary, the Centre organised a get-together for regular visitors to offer them a day full of fun and knowledge. Participants had an opportunity to have a free consultation with an Oncologist. The programme also included presentations on hydrotherapy, beauty culture and cookery. The invitees were provided a healthy breakfast and a lunch and enjoyed a musical session.



 Dr. Fernando said that although the Centre at commencement primarily targeted cancer patients, its services were extended to screening packages for a variety of health problems including diabetes and heart problems, making it a comprehensive health centre. She said the Centre has also become popular among people in the outstations, where medical screening facilities are virtually non-existent. 



 The Centre has dedicated Wednesday to offer all services within a day for those who book early. "On this day, visitors can undergo screening, collect their test reports and also meet their doctor and discuss further management of disease," Dr. Fernando said. "We are the only Centre that does needle biopsies and gives reports on the same day thus helping the patient to see the surgeon and discuss further treatment according to the report." Further enhancing its services, an ultra-modern Radiation Treatment Unit was set up a year ago. This unit houses the country's first Linear Accelerator, the international Gold Standard in the delivery of accurate, intensity-modulated radiation therapy for the treatment of many forms of cancer. Set up in affiliation with the Washington Hospital Centre, the Ceylinco Healthcare Centre is equipped for oral, breast, colorectal, stomach and cervical cancer screening as well as for genetic testing to identify high-risk families. Bringing together the expertise of a breast surgeon, oncologist, radiologist, pathologist, counsellor and a team of trained support staff, the unit offers tests such as mammography, colonoscopy, endoscopy, laryngoscopy, ultrasound screening and x-ray at the centre in comfortable and pleasant surroundings.

Sweet taste of success to Emirates with daily flights to Cote D'Ivoire The sweet taste of Emirates' success has taken on a new meaning after the airline introduced daily flights to Cote D'Ivoire, a leading producer of cocoa and a key ingredient behind one of the world's favourite treats, chocolate.

 Just two years after Emirates whetted the appetite of travellers to Abidjan with a five times a week service, demand has called for operations to go daily, and now they have.

 Under the new schedule, effective December 1st, EK flight 787 leaves Dubai each day at 0740hrs and arrives in Abidjan, Felix Houphouet Boigny Airport, at 1455hrs. 



 As before, flights to and from Abidjan, served by a 3-class Airbus A340-300, are making a quick stop in Accra, Ghana.

 Abidjan is one of the 15 destinations to which Emirates flies in Africa with most passengers flying in from Paris, Beirut, Accra, New York and Dubai. 

 The extra flights will be of particular benefit to passengers with connections to GCC countries, the wider Middle East and the Far East. 



 Salem Obaidalla, Emirates' Senior Vice President, Africa, West Asia & Indian Ocean, said: "This represents a further push by Emirates into West Africa and brings new support to business, international trade and passenger travel, while strengthening the country's overall transport infrastructure. And to think chocolate is part of the equation will only serve to give us an even greater taste for Africa." 



 Obaidalla added: "The introduction of this daily service comes just weeks after we announced a double daily flight to Lagos from February 1st next year. This is such an exciting continent for us and are delighted to be playing a part in its prolific growth."

 The West African nation, which has Guinea, Mali and Ghana amongst its neighbours, is one of the world's major producers and exporters of cocoa beans, coffee and palm oil. Abidjan is also a large commercial sea port, forming a gateway for the industrial world to and from Western Africa.



 Emirates, supported by Emirates SkyCargo, has been flying to the African continent since 1986, the year after the airline was established. 

 In just 23 years, the Dubai-based carrier has quickly grown into a major player on the aviation stage, boasting a 123-strong modern fleet, the world's largest A380 order book and a six continent route network. 

 The travel and tourism conglomerate has won more than 400 international awards for its products and services, helped no doubt, by its various chocolate offerings....
