The Island-NewsThe army yesterday captured the southern entrance to Elephant Pass after a fierce battle.

Troops of the 58 Division fighting their way along the A-9 highway northwards wrested control of the southern part of the Elephant Pass causeway known as Thamilamadam.

"We are pushing the enemy further into the North," Military Spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said.

The LTTE put up heavy resistance though its defences were not so well-fortified. Its presence is limited to a number of bunker points and small camps in the areas. Both sides suffered considerable damage according to independent sources but the casualty figures were not immediately available.

With the capture of the causeway, the army is now positioned 5 km away from the place where a sprawling army camp once stood near the well-known landmark, the Elephant Pass Rest House. That military installation fell to the LTTE in 2000. Brig. Nanayakkara said the troops would resume their thrust towards Elephant Pass after consolidating the newly gained territory and clearing it of booby traps and mines.

Meanwhile, the 59 Division continued its march towards Mullativu. The Task Force IV now stationed at Oddusudan will advance on the western flank of Mullaitivu.

The army would target the LTTE fortifications at Killali, Muhamalai and Nagarkovil after capturing Elephant Pass, defence sources said. Some of the army formations which captured Kilinochchi would also join the 59 Division and Task Force IV to attack the LTTE's Sea Tiger bastion at Mullaitivu.

The army yesterday handed over 25 bodies of LTTE cadres, including senior members and a female leader, to the ICRC for transfer.

The SLFA helicopter gunships provided air cover to the 59 Division engaged in battling the LTTE north-east of Oddusudan. Several key LTTE targets in Mullativu and its environs had been destroyed, Air Force Spokesman Wing Commander Janaka Nanayakkara said yesterday.
