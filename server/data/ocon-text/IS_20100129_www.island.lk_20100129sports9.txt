The Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA) on Thursday (28) said it had selected the national team for the forthcoming Davis Cup (Asia-Oceania Zone Group-II) to be held in Colombo against the strong New Zealanders from March 5-7.

According to the Davis Cup rules, each participating country should nominate a four-member team, plus another player as the None-playing Captain for the Davis Cup, a month before the scheduled start of a tie.

In the recent years, Sri Lanka's top player and the only one to be ranked in the men's international professional tennis circuit, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Harshana Godamanna, has been an automatic entry into the Sri Lankan side.

Then the SLTA, under its newly appointed National Selection Committee, headed by Suresh Subramaniam, picked four players out of an initial pool of 14 players last December through trails.

On January 23 and 24, the SLTA held the final round of trails to omit one player from the squad of four and in those trials Weerasekera lost both his matches to lose his place in this year's Sri Lanka team.
