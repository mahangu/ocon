Nine Army personnel who were arrested with two service pistols in their possession during a joint services and Police round up at the Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel on 27 (Wednesday) were being detained and interrogated under the Army Act, Army Spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara told The Island yesterday.

The army personnel, members of presidential candidate Sarath Fonseka's security contingent, along with several opposition politicians had been staying in that hotel since Tuesday evening.

He said the arrested personnel were being interrogated by the commanding officers of their respective units to find whether charge sheets could be issued against them at a summary inquiry.

Asked whether the deserters would be charged before a military tribunal and punished, the military spokesman said that punishment depended on the nature of the charges viz. unceremonious discharge, confining to the barracks and penalties etc.
