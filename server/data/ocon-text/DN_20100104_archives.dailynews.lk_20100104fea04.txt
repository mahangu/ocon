Beginning of a new era

Road construction going full steam ahead.

It was only during the past four years the focus of development turned to Ampara District. The people of the district was trampled under the scorch of the terrorist menace and suffered without any development whatsoever. The farmers who suffered from the hazards of elephants and from the peril of tiger terrorists brought their produce to market places trekking miles and miles in the muddy pathways beaten by rains and scalded by pitiless sun.

The government's development in the district started with the improvement of road structure. Accordingly the number of road development projects carried out in the Ampara district from 2006 â€“ 2009 amounted to 2708 projects at a cost of Rs. 1,401,762 million.
