P. P. Jamis had been in Remand Jail and at the Mental Hospital for 50 years. But no authority or person is held responsible. He is fortunate that he is able to spend the last years of his life with his relations in his village.

The President responding very quickly gifted Rs. 500,000 to him and arranged for a visit to Temple Trees to meet the President. Nodoubt he will cherish the memory of his visit to the end of his life. But before he spends the principal amount, the Presidential Secretariat should arrange with the NSB to pay a special rate of interest over 15% on a Fixed Deposit, to ensure that he receives monthly an amount more than Rs. 6000/ for his day to day expenses.

He is on bail and has to retain lawyers and the Police prosecution is also pending, and in order to be free himself from the alleged offence he will be tempted to be generous with his money. The Attorney General, if he has authority should determine the necessity to proceed with a prosecution.
