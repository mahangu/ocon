Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse NewspapersA mobile textbook distribution service which is being conducted throughout the country by the Educational Publications Department was held at the Zonal Education office, Mawanella, last week.

The service was carried out by the Educational Publications Department of the Ministry of Education to remedy the textbook shortage in schools throughout the country. Before commencing the mobile service, the Department distributed the required number of textbooks to Divisional Educational offices through the relevant Zonal Education offices to ensure that every student receives his/her textbooks at the very beginning of the first school term.

However, several principals have requested the Educational Publications Department for more textbooks. As the mobile service will reach every Educational Zone, principals can obtain the required number of textbooks without calling over at the Educational Publications Department.

"In the previous years we had to go to Colombo to bring the required textbooks spending time and money, a principal said.
