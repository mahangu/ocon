The police are investigating an alleged attempt to assassinate National Freedom Front leader Wimal Weerawansa, MP, at a recent propaganda rally in the Homagama electorate.

Sources said that security personnel deployed at a check point close to Jalthara, Homagama where Weerawansa had addressed a gathering last Sunday (Jan 17) arrested a person carrying a galkattas (improvised gun).

The police say that subsequent investigations revealed that the suspect had been a member of the Deshapremi Janatha Viyaparaya (DJV), the military wing of the JVP. He had been detained at Boossa for about two years and was believed to be planning to target the former JVP heavyweight.

They said that at the time security personnel stopped him, he was riding a motor cycle. According to sources the suspect had told police that he was targeting another person though there was no evidence to substantiate that claim. The suspect was planning to leave for Malaysia via Singapore, the sources said. (SF)
