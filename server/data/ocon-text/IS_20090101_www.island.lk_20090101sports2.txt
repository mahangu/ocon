Architect of South Africa's historic win over Australia, pacer Dale Steyn on Tuesday said if the Proteas continue to play with the same zeal they would soon get rid of the 'chokers' tag.

"I just feel so relieved or privileged I am not sure exactly how I feel to be part of a team that has come down here and been successful," said Steyn, who scalped 10 wickets besides scoring a half century in the second Test here which the Proteas won by nine wickets to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.

"This side is a young side with its De Villiers, Duminy, Amlas and Morkels who are mostly playing their first Test matches here and they are going to carry on playing Test cricket for a long time.

"We don't have that kind of history that word chokers keeps on coming up and if we can start our careers like this and take it forward, we can start a new generation of cricket and South African cricketers. I am very proud to be part of a side that has achieved something special," he added Steyn feels the Proteas have a lethal attack with a great captain at the helm of affairs.

"I feel we have a great attack with a lot of maturity about it represented by Makhaya and Jacques, then you get the other three of us and we seem to be learning all the time. And we are also supported by a great captain," he said.
