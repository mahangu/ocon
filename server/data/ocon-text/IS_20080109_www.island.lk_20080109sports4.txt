The evergreen Deepika Rodrigo of Lake House SC won a Triple Crown -- Women's Singles, Doubles and Mixed Doubles at the 61st National Table Tennis Championship, organized by the Table Tennis Association, and worked off at the St. Thomas' Indoor Stadium, Mount Lavinia, on Monday (8).

Top seed Rohan Sirisena, of Nugegoda TT Club won the Men's Championship beating Indika Prasad in an almost one sided final (11-1,11-7,12-10,14-12). Rohan Sirisena was at his utmost best in the final as he totally outplayed his energetic opponent in straight sets. It was his first national championship in the absence of Thilina Piyadasa, the defending and six time National champion who migrated to the USA.

Deepika Rodrigo, the reigning champion, for a record nine years, beat the most promising youngster in the local Table Tennis scene, Ishara Madurangi of Sri Devananda College, Ambalangoda in the Women's Singles final by four sets to one (11-8,7-11,11-6,12-10,11-6).

Ishara, a powerful shot maker, was undone by the clever, disguised service of Deepika for most parts of the game.

In the Women's Doubles final, Deepika together with Ruhansi Wijekoon of Maliyadeva Balika MV, Kurunegala, had to toil hard to overcome stubborn resistance from the young pair of Srimali Wimalarathne and Jayamali Udagedara of Holy Family Balika, Kurunegala. In the Mixed Doubles, Deepika, together with her husband, Indika Prasad beat Ishara Madurangi and G. P. H. Sajith in straight sets.

The Men's Doubles final was yet again a one sided affair as second seed Indika Prasad together with his brother Nuwan Sampath beat K. S. T. Lakshan and G. P. H. Sajith in straight sets.
