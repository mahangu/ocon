SLFP (Mahajana Wing) leader Mangala Samaraweera, MP yesterday denied reports by a section of the media that Presidential candidate General (retd) Sarath Fonseka had assaulted him at a hotel in Colombo on Wednesday.

Fonseka's joint Media Spokesman, Samaraweera said he had been in Matara since January 25 and arrived in Colombo only yesterday (Thursday) morning.

"I went to Matara to cast my vote and organise the people for the victory of Gen. Fonseka. I came to Colombo on Thursday. However, Gen. Fonseka called me on Wednesday and told me about rumours being spread that he had assaulted me.

Samaraweera said he sent a letter to IGP Mahinda Balasuriya informing him of the harassment and election violence against opposition supporters and his properties in Matara on January 22, but the IGP had not responded to his letter.
