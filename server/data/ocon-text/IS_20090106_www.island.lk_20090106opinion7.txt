The Island-OpinionI am not a supporter of any political party or group but I was very happy when I heard that Prabhakaran lost Kilinochchi because the people can now hope to live more peacefully once the terrorists are defeated.

However, there were two very ugly incidents on the day of victory, January 2nd 2009. Both were obviously calculated moves on the part of anti-establishment forces to make the people forget the victory. The first was the suicide bombing at the entrance to the Air Force HQ in Colombo which killed three and injured 37.

The other was Ranil's attempt to divert the attention of the celebrating masses by telling them that the price of oil must be reduced at once in accordance with the SC order.

Both the suicide bomber and Ranil may have expected the people of this country to forget the great victory.
