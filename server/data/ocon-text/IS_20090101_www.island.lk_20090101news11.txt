The army on the Vanni front was about to liberate Paranthan and isolate LTTE units fighting south and west of Kilinochchi, senior military officials said.

They said that Task Force I (TF I) would cut off the A9 road north of Paranthan and push along the Paranthan-Mullaitivu road. This would increase pressure on LTTE units deployed on the neck of Jaffna peninsula to face 53 and 55 Divisions.

With Tuesday's liberation of Thadduwankoddy and Komarikudakulam villages situated close to Paranthan, the army was in a position to overrun the town, a senior official told The Island. The villages are located about 2 km west of Paranthan.

The army said that TF I would push eastwards along Paranthan-Mullaitivu (A 35) road until it linked up with 59 Division now battling its way towards the A-35 road from the direction of Mulliyawalai. The army said that Vaddakachchi and Puthukkudiyiruppu, the last two major civilian centres under the LTTE control would be vulnerable to an army assault.

While Vaddakachchi is expected to come under attack by TF I, 59 Division is likely to push towards Puthukkudiyiruppu, where the ICRC maintained its only office in the Vanni region.

The liberation of Paranthan would facilitate a multi-pronged assault on Kilinochchi, the army said, adding that 57 Division was on the offensive with units breaching heavily fortified LTTE defence lines in several locations North of Akkarayankulam and north of Iranamadu.

The 59 Division was also likely to cut across Oddussudan-Puthukkudiyiruppu road, the army said, expressing confidence that the LTTE would find it extremely difficult to face the army on several fronts as the area under its control continued to shrink. (SF)
