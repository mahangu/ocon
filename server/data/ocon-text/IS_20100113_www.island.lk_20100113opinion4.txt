I write this after reading two letters which appeared in The Island on 09/01/2010 in response to two previous letters published on this subject.

Sir Arthur C Clarke too is quoted, re his belief in rebirth and one writer refers to Dr Carlo Fonseka's remarks regarding one such reported case under the caption 'hysteria or rebirth', from which it can be implied what he thinks of this concept.

Buddhists now do not say Rebirth; instead they call this process rebecoming, as both rebirth and reincarnation refer to a soul which is either reborn or reincarnated, which is different to the Buddha's concept of re-becoming.

As observed by writer M Abeyratne, who is a Rationalist, this concept cannot be scientifically proved, like most theories. Conversely, this concept cannot be conclusively disproved, to call it hysteria, as had been seen by Christians, who had investigated a few cases. What Buddhists believe is what the Buddha 'Saw before attaining enlightenment, with his Omniscient vision, beings dying and been reborn in the 32 forms of life, mentioned by him. He saw 'Reality' as it happened; then he himself saw 500 of his previous life-forms which are related in the Jataka Stories.

Can both writers reject what the Buddha saw, as hysteria? There are several investigated cases of recalled previous lives, published by the renowned Dr Ian Stevenson on this subject, which are hard to reject as hysteria. There is also a unique book entitled the Reincarnation of Peter Proud by Max Ehlich which was published in 1974, on which a film too was shown in Sri Lanka.

The much-quoted book Many Mansions is yet another book which relates accounts of such recalled cases of rebirth, which though unexplained scientifically, remain disproved.
