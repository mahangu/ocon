Australia retained off-colour Matthew Hayden and replaced the injured trio of Brett Lee, Andrew Symonds and Shane Watson with three uncapped players for the third and final cricket Test against South Africa.

Having already conceded the three-match series to Graeme Smith's men, the selectors on Tuesday drafted in three uncapped players — pacemen Doug Bollinger and Ben Hilfenhaus and all-rounder Andrew McDonald — in the 12-man squad.

The change in the squad was forced by injuries to Lee, Symonds and Watson.

South Africa has already sealed the series with a crushing nine-wicket win in the second Test and will now aim for a whitewash which will help it dethrone the Aussies as number one Test team.

Impressive show

NSP Chairman Andrew Hilditch said all the new faces in the squad earned their place by virtue of their impressive show in the domestic cricket.

"The National Selection Panel has introduced Doug Bollinger and Ben Hilfenhaus to the squad. Both are having exceptional Sheffield Shield seasons and their ability to move the ball will add depth to the bowling attack, albeit that they have big shoes to fill in those of Brett Lee.

"Andrew McDonald has been a very consistent all-rounder for Victoria for several seasons. He is in very good form and as well as batting in the top six will give us the flexibility we need with our bowling attack," Hilditch said.

Hilditch was effusive in his praise for the visitors.

"While we are obviously disappointed to lose the series to South Africa , the reality is we have got ourselves in very good positions to win both Test matches.

Strong side

"It must be said that South Africa has played extremely good cricket and is a very strong side," he said.
