England insist Andrew Flintoff's recovery from ankle surgery is "progressing well" even though he has pulled out of the Lions tour of India, BBC Sport reported on its website.

The all-rounder, 30, was set to step up his rehabilitation with England's second-tier players in late January.

He will now work on his fitness with Lancashire, who have a training camp in India in late February before competing in a tournament in Dubai in March.

Flintoff underwent a fourth operation on his left ankle in October.

It ruled him out of the winter tours of Sri Lanka and New Zealand but the England management were hoping he could feature as a batsman with the Lions, who will take part in the first-class Duleep Trophy in India.

An England and Wales Cricket Board spokesman insisted the latest development was not a cause for concern.

"It was never definitely decided that Andrew was going to join up with the Lions squad, it was only ever a possibility," he told BBC Sport.

"The medical team have decided that it would be in his best interests to continue his progress, which is going very well, with Lancashire."

The 14-man Lions squad departs for India on 23 January, with spinner Monty Panesar in the squad before he travels to New Zealand for the three-Test series with the senior team.
