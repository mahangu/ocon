The following is the full text of the statement issued by the TULF Chief:

"The TULF very strongly condemns the most brutal and cowardly act of the LTTE that caused the death of 26 innocent civilians and also left, over sixty five seriously injured. It is high time the LTTE stops killing innocent civilians, which is not going to serve any purpose other than infuriating the International Community, which is fast losing its patience. There should be no place for ferocious animals in the human society. We as humans have a sacred duty to perform. Without playing hide and seek, every one should express their deep concern.

"I have more than once found fault with the media, particularly the Tamil media all over the world for their failure to condemn these ruthless activities of the LTTE. Their failure to do so, in one way amounts to encouraging the LTTE to terrorize the civilians more and more. Some Human Rights activists too make the same mistake. I call upon all the people, whichever community they belong to, the media, human rights organizations and heads of all political parties, including the TNA, to condemn this ruthless act and to urge the LTTE to spare the innocent village folk who depend on each other in their family, for survival. This united demand will act as a deterrent for any such activities in the future and will also make them realize that they are not going to be tolerated forever. I also plead with the International Community to ignore whatever adverse comment some might have made in reference to their activities and to warn the LTTE that they will not just keep on watching the atrocious acts perpetrated on the civilians.

I express my deepest sympathies for the relatives of the unfortunate victims."
