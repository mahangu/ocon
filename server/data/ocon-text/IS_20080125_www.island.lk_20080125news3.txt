A former LTTE cadre and his family have sought the help of the Navy to get away from the clutches of the terrorist group and settle down in their new home in Pallimunai.

The family from Vellankulam, 16 km off Vidathaltivu, north of Mannar, who were heading for Pallimunai, on Wednesday sought the Navy's help to reach their destination after a perilous journey in a dinghy fitted with a 9.8hp engine.

The 31-year-old fisherman had sailed off on the 16 km journey with his 24-year-old wife and three-year-old son under cover of darkness.

The man had admitted that he was a former LTTE cadre and had served in the LTTE reserve. The Tiger leadership had deprived him of engaging in his livelihood of fishing.

He and many others in the neighbourhood, were forcibly taken away by the Tigers to dig trenches for bunkers.

"Only the very old and the feeble were spared and others were forced to work under harsh conditions during a greater part of the month," he had said.

The fisherman told the Navy that he was forced to undergo three months training, in July last year, in an LTTE camp in Kilinochchi. He showed Navy officials three photographs taken on the completion of training. One showed him handling a Rocket Propelled Grenade (RPG) launcher, one wearing a pistol and another showing him astride a motor cycle carrying a communication set.

A spokesman for the Navy said the family was directed to the Pallimunai police and later suitable arrangements will be made to despatch them to their new home.
