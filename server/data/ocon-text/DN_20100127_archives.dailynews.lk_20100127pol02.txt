SF violated election law, says UPFA

UPFA General Secretary Susil Premajayantha said they have given a letter to Elections Commissioner Dayananda Dissanayake informing that New Democratic Front candidate Sarath Fonseka had violated election laws by appearing before the electronic media and making open statements about his not being able to vote for himself as a Presidential candidate.

"Presidential candidate Fonseka was telling the electronic media why he did not cast his vote, and that his name was not on the electoral register",said Premajayantha. Fonseka was making these statementsto the media on the day of the polls(January 26) between 7am and 4 pm, during the time of polling, which is a clear violation of the Election Law, he pointed out.

Premajayantha was speaking at a press conference held yesterday at the Media Centre for National Security in Colombo.

"Former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva and Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe too had made statements supporting this candidate", he said

"We have reservations whether Wickremesinghe and former Presidential lawyer and MP Wijedasa Rajapaksa knew or not that Fonseka's name was not on the electoral list at the time that Fonseka's nimination for the Presidential election was submitted to the Elections Commissioner, or they all knew this and misled the public of Sri Lanka," he said.

Minister Prof G L Peiris said "if one does not have the legal qualifications to cast one's vote or to become an "elector",one is not entitled to become elected in keeping with Sri Lankan law.
