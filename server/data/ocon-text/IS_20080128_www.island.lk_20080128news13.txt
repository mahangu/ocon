A person who allegedly entered a house in the Ahangama police area in the early hours of Saturday had been shot dead by a woman resident there. Police said that the intruder identified as Prasanna Abeyruwan (25) had been shot with a 12 bore shot gun at almost point blank range. According to police, the victim had been allegedly involved in several previous robberies. A police spokesman said that the weapon had been licened.

But the victim's relatives have claimed the Prasanna had been on his way from his mother's home to his sister's home when he was shot.
