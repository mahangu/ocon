MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) - Andy Roddick has no concerns about illness limiting Roger Federer's buildup for an Australian Open title defense.

Federer complained of a serious stomach virus on the weekend and withdrew from the Kooyong exhibition tournament where he usually fine-tunes for the first Grand Slam event of the season.

"None of us will be losing sleep over it," Roddick joked at a news conference Tuesday, looking across at the other seven players on the panel with him who are in the Kooyong field.

Roddick beat Federer in the Kooyong final last year, two days before the Australian Open started.

The result did not go on their official win-loss records and did not seem to bother Federer, who went on to defend the Australian Open singles crown.

Federer also won Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, and now has 12 Grand Slam titles, two short of Pete Sampras' world record.

The Swiss star, who arrived in Australia last week, was replaced in the Kooyong draw by Marcos Baghdatis, the 2006 Australian Open finalist.

Also in the invitation-only field is 2007 Australian Open runnerup Fernando Gonzalez, former champion Marat Safin, David Nalbandian, Andy Murray, Ivan Ljubicic and Nikolay Davydenko, a late replacement for Germany's Tommy Haas.
