Act wisely to safeguard Motherland - Defence Secretary

What we face today is not yet another Presidential election. This is a critical election that would decide the existence or the destruction of our Motherland, said a statement issued by the Government Information Department yesterday.

"We were able to end a very difficult period of over 30 years that the country faced. World's most ruthless terrorism was defeated at the cost of over 27, 000 lives of war heroes who defended the Motherland. Unfortunately all treacherous forces that acted against this victory from the inception are now united in attempting to reverse this great victory," it said.

"In the meantime all local political forces that opposed the victory have come into an alliance. The international community and the NGOs and INGOs have all joined them. These enemy forces are joined by all parties connected with the common enemy of our Motherland, the LTTE," it said.

Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa expressed confidence that all war heroes belonging to the Army, Navy, Air Force, Police and the Civil Defence Force as well as all public servants would realize this reality and act wisely to defeat all hostile forces that are working to betray the victorious country, the statement further said.
