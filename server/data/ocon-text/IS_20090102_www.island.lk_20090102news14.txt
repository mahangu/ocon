The Island-NewsThe UNP and SLFP (M) backed NGO, Corruption Watch, yesterday described the recent fuel price reduction and relief package by the Government as just another eye-wash.

"The Government was forced to bring down the fuel and gas prices thanks to the agitation and active pressure by the Corruption Watch against its corruptions and frauds including the controversial hedging deal. We took legal action to save Rs 40,000 million on the verge being swindled by several politicians and few foreign banks.

" In addition, it was we who went before the court to get a ruling to reduce the petrol prices to Rs 100 per litre in favour of the masses," the Corruption Watch said in a release issued to the media yesterday.

The release also said: "Those who had been deprived of the Rs 40,000 millions are now irate and plan every gimmick in the book to delay the implementation of the court order. It is a diabolical lie that the government spends the money saved through the court order on people's welfare in the meantime it earns a profit over 180% from petrol taxes.

"The so-called relief package and reduction of oil prices is a deception. Price of diesel could bring down to Rs 40 per litre while the petrol price may possibly be reduced to Rs 80 a litre. Without doing that to ease the burden, the Government plays tricks with plans of reducing Rs 20 for three wheelers. This trick had caused for additional troubles of introducing meters, providing Rs 5000 advance, and to waste the time of three wheeler owners in queues. It seems that there is a plan to import three wheelers to the local market to obtain huge amount of profits."
