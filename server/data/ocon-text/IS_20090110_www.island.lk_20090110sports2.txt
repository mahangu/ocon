Australian reports have claimed that Kevin Pietersen approached his former Hampshire captain Shane Warne about taking over as England coach.

WIth six months to go until the Ashes begins, the spin may have already started after the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Pietersen, who resigned yesterday as England captain, approached Warne over the possibility of succeeding Peter Moores.

Sources told the newspaper that Pietersen's vision was to have the former Australia spinner as coach alongside former Victoria captain Darren Berry and former England all-rounder Jeremy Snape as assistants.

Berry and Snape were part of the Rajasthan Royal coaching set-up which won the inaugural IPL title last year.

After his working relationship with Peter Moores broke down, Pietersen issued a "sack me or back me" ultimatum to the ECB, confident that the governing body would bow to his demand and get rid of the coach.

According to the Sydney paper, Warne refused to comment on the matter but did not deny that Pietersen had approached him after the fall-out with Moores was made public.

Andrew Strauss, who has been unveiled as the new England captain at Lord's, denied that divisions within the England team were as deep as had been suggested. However, he acknowledged they had to be addressed immediately.

The 31-year-old said: "You believe the rifts in the dressing room are greater than they are.

"From the points of view of some players and some of the management we need to get it sorted out."

Last week, former England captain Graham Gooch weighed into the debate over the Pietersen-Moores furore by suggesting that the outgoing captain had been "influenced a little bit by Shane Warne at Hampshire".

Gooch said: "Warne was a great motivator as a player but, as one of the all-time icons of the game and after leading the Rajasthan Royals to the IPL title last year, he doesn't really believe in coaching."
