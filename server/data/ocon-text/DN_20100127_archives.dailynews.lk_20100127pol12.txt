Brisk polling in Kandy

There was brisk polling and no incidents were reported from Kandy at the Presidential election held yesterday.

A very large number of voters turned up at several polling booths in Kandy and Senkadagala electorates from early morning to cast their votes.

Kandy police headed by Central Province West DIG Pujith Jayasundera maintained tight security at the polling stations. There was a lot of enthusiasm among voters as they waited patiently in the long queues for their turn to cast their votes.

It was all peaceful and no incidents were reported at the time of writing, a good indication of the officials performing their tasks and the public in turn respecting peace.
