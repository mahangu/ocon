The Opposition's Presidential Candidate General (retd) Sarath Fonseka is now under indirect house arrest, Parliamentarian Mangala Samaraweera said.

Addressing a press conference in Colombo, Fonseka's joint media spokesman Samaraweera said that the government shamelessly removed Gen. Fonseka's security just after releasing the final results of the election.

"It is the government's responsibility to ensure Gen. Fonseka's security, not because he was the presidential candidate, but because he is the former Commander who led the Sri Lanka Army to defeat the LTTE. He is now facing a serious security threat and even the police officer guarding his house has been removed. He can't go outside and is thus under indirect house arrest," Samaraweera said.

He said that due to death threats to Gen. Fonseka and his supporters, including former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva and UNP Maharagama Organiser Wijedasa Rajapaksha, they stayed in a hotel in Colombo on Wednesday. But the government held them under siege for hours by deploying around 300 to 400 Army personnel. They blocked Fonseka's passage to the Elections Secretariat.

Samaraweera said that Fonseka has a good future as a politician and the Rajapaksas were trying to block it.
