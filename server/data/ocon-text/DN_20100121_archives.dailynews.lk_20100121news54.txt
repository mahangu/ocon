Plantation TUs working for President's victory

P. Rajaratnam in Nuwara Eliya

Major Plantation Trade Unions such as the Ceylon Workers' Congress led by Minister Arumugam Thondaman and the Upcountry Workers' front led by Shanthini Chandrasekaran, the wife of late Minister Periyasamy Chandrasekaran are working towards the victory of President Mahinda Rajapaksa in the forthcoming presidential elections.

Already several meetings and election campaigns have been held in the plantations explaining and demonstrating the vast development perspectives taking place in the Estates in the recent past under the Government.

It was during the government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, a reasonable wage increase to the plantation workers was granted whenever, the wage issue of the estate workers was raised.

Hence, it is fitting and appropriate that the plantation workers should support the election of the present President Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Mahinda Chintanaya.
