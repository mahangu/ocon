Uditha Kumarasinghe and Irangika Range

Public Administration and Home Affairs Minister and Deputy Finance Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama told the Parliament yesterday that the Government has to grant housing rent allowance to Ministers due to serious security threats faced by them.

The Minister was responding to the adjournment motion moved by the UNP members Dayasiri Jayasekera.

The minister said no Minister had requested the Government to provide the Rs. 100,000 housing rent allowance.

They only requested the Government to provide them with a Government residence.

However, the Public Administration Ministry did not have the capacity to provide a Government residence to each minister. Most of the ministers come from rural areas and have faced, severe security threat from the LTTE.

Therefore a Cabinet decision was taken to provide a housing rent allowance to the ministers. This has also been included in the Budget as well.

If the Government can provide houses to all Ministers there is no need to grant this housing rent allowance, the Minister said.

MP Dayasiri Jayasekera said a housing rent allowance of Rs. 100,000 had been paid to a large number of ministers from 2007. This allowance has been reduced to Rs. 50,000 with effect from January 2009.

According to the article 68 of the Constitution the Parliament has been vested with powers to pay a salary or an allowance to the Members of parliament including the Ministers, Deputy Minister, the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker and the Deputy Chairman of Committees, he said.

Jayaskera said the constitution has vested full powers in parliament in relation to the control of public finance, the payment of housing rent allowance by the secretaries of the relevant ministries is a violation of the powers and privileges vested in the parliaments by the Constitution, he said.
