January 16 2008: Former Pakistan spinner Saqlain Mushtaq has admitted he would like to play for England.

The Surrey off-spinner, who married an Englishwoman, played for Sussex last year on a British passport and qualifies for England in April.

The 31-year-old has played 49 Tests and 169 one-day internationals for Pakistan but has been overlooked for the past four years.

Saqlain told BBC London: "If they [England] call me, definitely I'll play. I've been discussing with my family and friends and they've all been saying 'Saqqy, if they give you the chance, definitely go for it'."
