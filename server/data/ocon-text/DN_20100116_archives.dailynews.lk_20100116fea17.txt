An artist from Vanuatu

Nicolai Michitouchkine, an artist of Russian descent now domiciled in the Republic of Vanuatu in the South Pacific, arrived at the Immigration counter at BIA Katunayake early this week to be told that he could not enter Sri Lanka on the passport he proffered. The Immigration officers told him that Vanuatu was not on their list of recognized countries and that they had never heard of it.

Nicolai Michitouchkine was understandably shocked, because Vanuatu is a Commonwealth Country and was infact represented at the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Trinidad and Tobago, which was attended by Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka, and about fifty other world leaders. Vanuatu declared itself a republic about thirty years ago when it was freed from Anglo-French dominion. It was earlier known as the New Hebrides.

Michitouchkine had been in Sri Lanka earlier when he travelled on a French passport before he became a citizen of Vanuatu. His Russian parents had emigrated to France early last century and he grew up there. On his first visit to Sri Lanka in 1956 he held an exhibition of paintings in Colombo which was opened by Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike.

Michitouchkine's work has greatly influenced the paintings of the Sri Lanka born painter George Beven who met him in Colombo. One of the techniques of painting Beven adopted after Michitouchkine was to paint with his fingers on reed mats.

George Beven who now lives in London was on a visit to Sri Lanka recently.
