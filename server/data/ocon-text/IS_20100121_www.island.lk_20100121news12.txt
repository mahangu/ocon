The Government of Japan granted Japanese 29 million Yen (approximately Rs. 36 million) for the preparation of detailed designs for the construction of five bridges in the Eastern Province.

The Eastern province was badly affected by the conflict during the past 30 years, where most of its infrastructure facilities including roads were destroyed or damaged.

The proposed five bridges under the Japanese aid would contribute to the rehabilitation programme carried out by the Government as well as the improvement of the living conditions of the people in the Eastern Province.

The preparation of detailed designs of Panichchankeni Causeway, a bridge on the A 15 (Batticaloa-Trincomalee) road and four other bridges, 240/4 bridge, Mundeni River bridge, Pulavady bridge and 287/7 bridge on the Peradeniya-Badulla-Chenkalady road will be done making use of this grant.

These bridges were constructed during the colonial period and are over 50 years old.

The project will be implemented by the Road Development Authority under the supervision of the Ministry of Highways and Road Development.

The signing of the Exchange of Notes in Colombo took place between Kunio Takahashi, Ambassador of Japan in Sri Lanka and P B Jayasundara, Secretary, Ministry of Finance and Planning.
