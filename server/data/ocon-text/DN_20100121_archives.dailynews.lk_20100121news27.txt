Program to provide medical equipment

The Healthcare and Nutrition Ministry has commenced a program to provide medical equipment to all central government and provincial hospitals at a cost of Rs. 2,500 million.

Medical equipment at provincial hospitals are outdated and Provincial Councils have found it difficult to replace them due to lack of funds.

The Health Ministry has requested these hospitals to provide a list of medical items needed.

The President has agreed to provide financial allocation to meet vitally needed items, Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said. The objective behind this initiative is to strengthen the existing free health services.
