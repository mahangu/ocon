"Unlike voters having to wait for six years to defeat a minister or a politician who had broken their promises, trade unions do not have to wait for six years to win their demands," All Ceylon Transport Workers Union General Secretary Sepala Liyanage said at a press conference at Nippon Hotel in Colombo yesterday. Many would wonder why they, the Transport Workers Union is silent today despite having planned a massive islandwide protest campaign.

"Though we have the strength to do it, after spending nearly Rs. 40,000 on posters, etc., we stopped it with a mutual trust. Some might consider that we are foolish but we are patient," Liyanage said.

He said Transport Minister Dullas Alahapperuma at a crucial discussion held on Wednesday at the Presidential Secretariat, assured them their demands would be looked into and settled soon.

He added: "We don't know whether it was a false or a genuine pledge given by the Minister to solve our demands. We did have a very cordial discussion and unlike others ministers, he was down to earth, but only in April we would know whether he was acting or genuine in his deals."

Liyanage said for nearly three years they have not received their cost of living allowance. At present it stands at Rs. 13,500. However, Minister Alahapperuma promised Rs. 5,000 of the amount be paid with the April salary.

He said that Alahapperuma had assured them that the balance would be paid in two installments, Rs. 4,500 and Rs. 4,000.

He said the Transport Minister said that drivers, conductors and technicians would be permitted to work till 60 years and the same numbering to 38,000, would receive their letters of appointment within six months.
