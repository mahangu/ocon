Power Energy Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne has instructed the Ceylon Electricity Board Energy Purchasing Branch not to pay more for electricity produced by the Kerawalapitiya Power Plant.

"I have informed the chairman of Lanka Transformers Limited to provide electricity at Rs,18.00 per unit though the cost is nearly Rs. 40.00," he told The Island

They agreed to provide a unit at Rs. 18.00. Seneviratne said that earlier they were using special furnace oil and the cost of the unit was very high. They use less costly sulphur oil now, he said.

However, CEB sources said that Kerawalapitiya Plant cannot provide electricity at Rs. 18.00 as stated by the minister and at the same time the Minister cannot bring down the unit price according to the Power Project Agreement.
