The Island-SportsThe 37-year-old said on Thursday he hadn't even considered retiring from international cricket since the series-clinching second Test loss to the South Africans in Melbourne on Tuesday." I'm not sure going after you lose a series, in the middle of the series, would be the right time to go.

There's absolutely no doubt about that," said Hayden." So I didn't think about it for a minute." Asked whether he was looking ahead to the Ashes tour later this year, Hayden stressed his entire focus was on Sydney Test. Hayden shared a press conference at the SCG nets with former teammate Glenn McGrath and he received the legendary pace man's backing.

McGrath said he would always have Hayden in any Australian team. Asked what advice he would give to Hayden, McGrath said just to approach this match like every other Test. McGrath said both Ben Hilfenhaus and Doug Bollinger, vying for the pace bowling spot vacated by the injured Brett Lee, were very good bowlers but he declined to offer a preference.

However, he was interested by the rare prospect of two left arm pace men, Bollinger and new Test spearhead Mitchell Johnson, bowling together. McGrath was at the SCG to help promote the McGrath Foundation which raises awareness of breast cancer. Pink McGrath Foundation bandanas will be distributed at the Test.
