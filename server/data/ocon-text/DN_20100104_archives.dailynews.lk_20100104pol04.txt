Strong parties backing President - Former Chief Minister

Former Western Provincial Council Chief Minister Reginald Cooray said the country has faced a very crucial decision making moment.

"President Mahinda Rajapaksa has 40 years political experience whereas his main rival has a mere 40 days in politics," he said at an election rally in support of President Rajapaksa on Saturday.

"We don't need a General who gives orders to shoot at those who defy orders. The Executive Presidential system has wide powers," he said. If a General is appointed to this post, it would lead to a military government. We only need a person from the village to hold this post," Cooray said.

"Fonseka says he will abolish Presidency if elected. But a President alone cannot do that without having the two third majority in Parliament along with an approval at a referendum. Fonseka has been appointed only to prop up the weak Opposition.

"Ranil Wickremesinghe was to create a record by losing at the 18th occasion," he said. "The JVP has also no strong candidate. This puppet party has installed another puppet at the Presidential Election which will only be a walkover for us," Cooray said.

"President Rajapaksa has a solid party with strong constituent parties to back him. Fonseka has no political party to claim," he said.

"What the President is engaged in today is to carry forward the flag which great kings such as Parakramabahu carried to protect the country," the former Chief Minister said.
