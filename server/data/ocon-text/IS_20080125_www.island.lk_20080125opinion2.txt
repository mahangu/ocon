I refer to the interesting article (The Island – Satmag of January 19th) written by David Trotter on the above subject, along with the observation that it constitutes what he deems to be 'Musings on H.L. Seneviratne's article – Sinhala Tamil'. I do not venture to offer any comments on the core position presented in this article, since it is a highly technical exposition of comparative linguistics.

In the course of his discourse DT refers to the comparative sounds of the Sinhala word 'vatura', the German 'wasser' and the Greek word 'vero'. In the limited context of the Attic version which is also considered to be classical Greek used by writers such as Sophocles, Plato, Xenophon and Thucydides, the word for water is '????' (hudor) from which the English prefix 'hydro' is derived. This same word and its inflexions that denote case (nominative, genitive etc.) are found in the Greek New Testament. Further, as far as I am aware, there is no equivalent of the letter 'v' in the Greek alphabet. The character 'v', in the same form as in the English alphabet, is used to stand for 'nu' in the Greek alphabet: the equivalent of 'n' in the English alphabet. I would be pleased if DT informs us whether the word 'vero' is found in a more ancient form of Greek or in Modern Greek. There was no character equivalent to the English letter 'f' in the Sinhala alphabet. For practical reasons involving the transliteration of proper names, the letter 'f' has been brought into the Sinhala language with the letter 'f' superimposed on the letter 'p'. The Greeks who could not boast of the letter 'f' used the letter '?' (phi). The world is moving so fast that, as Heraclitus said, we cannot step into the same river twice. The river is a flowing mass of water.
