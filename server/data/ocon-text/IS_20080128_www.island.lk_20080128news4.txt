Lanka Viduli Sevaka Sangamaya said that the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) has been forced to invest funds of its privately managed Provident Fund in government treasury bonds.

Ranjan Jayalal, General Secretary of the union, said that the workers strongly objected to the government interference and pressure being brought on the management to invest funds on the direction of Treasury Secretary Dr. P. B. Jayasundera.

According to him it would have better to invest the money in state banks which offer 16 per cent against 10-11.5 per cent offered by the Treasury. He revealed that in one month alone Rs 12,000 million had been taken.

The union also released a letter sent to the CEB by Chartered Accountants S. Saverimuttu and Company that emphasized that the Treasury had no right to interfere in the running of the Provident Fund. Referring to the decision to invest in Treasury bonds, the company said, "This decision of the board appears to have been influenced by instructions given by the Secretary to the Treasury Mr. P. B. Jayasundera in a letter dated October 4, 2005 addressed to the Chairman, CEB. We are of the opinion that the Secretary to the Treasury has no power to issue such instructions."

Jayalal said that they would launch an awareness campaign today (28) to pressure the government to stop interference and thereby ensuring the continuity of the CEB fund.(SF)
