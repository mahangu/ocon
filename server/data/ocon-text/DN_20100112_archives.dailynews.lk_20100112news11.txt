Fonseka has accepted 'Tamil Homeland' - Wickramabahu

Sarath Fonseka has accepted that the North and the East is the homeland of Tamils by the agreement he signed with the TNA now, Left Front Presidential candidate Wickramabahu Karunaratne said.

He asked those who called him a Tiger when he expressed the same view in 1974 what would they call Sarath Fonseka now.

He made this observations at a media briefing held at his residence in Kiribathkumbura on Saturday.

He observed that Fonseka had already given a bag of promises to the TNA. Also to enlist their support he had entered into certain agreements. "Now JVP's Anura Kumara Dissanayake has suddenly gone silent after this."

He said Fonseka has promised to release terrorist suspects, to resettle the displaced, to grant self rule and provide jobs etc.

What is not in the agreement is only the promise to return to life the people he killed when he was a military officer. Although the USA and the major European countries tried to strengthen the hold of multi-national companies through Mahinda Rajapaksa they failed in their bid.

"Now that they have lost hope in Mahinda Rajapaksa they have put forward Sarath Fonseka as a candidate to do their bidding."
