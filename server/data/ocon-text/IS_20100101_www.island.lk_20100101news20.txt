Nuwara Eliya District Secretary, D. P. G. Kumarasiri, said five families have been moved to another area from the Ilfondale Estate in Lindula as the threat of an earthslip is imminent.

"We are waiting for a report from the National Buildings and Research Institute and if the report is positive we will take appropriate action to provide alternate land and assistance for the residents after discussions with the estate management," he said.
