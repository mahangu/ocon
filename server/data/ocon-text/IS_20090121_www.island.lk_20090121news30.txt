The Ceylon Electricity Board's Joint Trade Alliance Front yesterday said it would resort to strong trade union action if the Sri Lanka Electricity Act is tabled in Parliament on Friday.

Power and Energy Ministry sources yesterday told The Island that Minister W. D. J. Seneviratne would possibly discuss the Act in Parliament this week.

Sources said that Seneviratne cannot keep on delaying the passage of the Act especially when loans from reputed banks like the Asian Development Bank were involved. In fact recently, he assured The Island that the Act would certainly benefit in bringing in an efficient service.

However, Joint Trade Alliance Front Committee Member H. A. Ranjan Jayalal told The Island that successive governments in the guise of `betterment for the public' had always taken disastrous decisions which had ultimately ruined the institution.

"We know if implemented this Act would weaken the powers of the CEB, despite the assurance of the ministry that distribution would be given only to government institutions," he said.

CEB Wurthiya Samithi Ekamuthuwa Convener Ananda Nimalaratne yesterday said, "This Act was rejected numerous times even before it was tabled in Parliament. Recently Minister Seneviratne assured us that that he would table it after the relevant amendments were incorporated."
