UNP Colombo North organiser resigns

Colombo North UNP organiser and former Parliamentarian K.B. Lilantha Perera has resigned from the post as well as his membership of the UNP working committee.

In a lengthy letter to Party Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, Perera cited his recent sidelining and the injustice meted out to him ignoring the sacrifices made by him and members of his family for the Party which prompted his decision to quit his posts in the Party which he served with dedication for the past 25 years.

He also referred to his sudden ouster from the Colombo North UNP organisership in 2007 and the division of the electorate by the party leader between himself and a complete newcomer ignoring the service he rendered to the electorate for 13 years.

Perera also recounted the sacrifices made by his family for the party including the death of his father and sister in the Thotalanga bomb blast.
