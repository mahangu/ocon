President Mahinda Rajapaksa, in violation of election laws, was campaigning for UPFA candidates at the forthcoming Central Provincial Council Election, the UNP said on Tuesday.

Kandy District UNP MP, Lakshman Kirielle, addressing a news conference in Colombo, alleged that in the absence of an independent Elections Commission, which should have been established in terms of the 17th Amendment, Mahinda Rajapaksa and his government continues to violate election laws with impunity.

"The law prohibits the President campaigning for candidates at an election, but he is openly flouting it. The reason why President Rajapaksa is delaying the establishment of the Constitutional Council and the independent commissions, is because his government can continue to abuse the state resources. But we have not been allocated any television or radio time to convey our message to the masses."

With an election round the corner, the government was clamouring for votes in the Central Province, after having neglected the region all these years, Kirielle charged. "There are 30,000 tea producers in Nuwara Eliya , Badulla and Kandy district but they are unable to fetch a good price for their produce."

He also said that around 70,000 persons in the Nuwara Eliya district were without identity cards and urged the government to regularize matters before the CPC election.

Accusing the government of falsely claiming that 5,000 UNPers had joined the UPFA, he said, that those shown by State television, were actually UPFA members clad in green clothes.
