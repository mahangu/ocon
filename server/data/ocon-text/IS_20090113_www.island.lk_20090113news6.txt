The Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union (CEBEU) yesterday condemned the move to hand over the operations and maintenance of the USD 455 million Norochcholai Coal Power Plant to Lanka Coal Company.

A senior engineer of the CEBEU told The Island yesterday that the CEB had been successfully operating and maintaining more than 20 Power Plants in the country.

The CEB has the best technical expertise in the country for maintaining and operating power plants compared to many developing countries.

He said "It is unclear how and why a newly established company, the Lanka Coal Company Ltd. was preferred to do the job ahead of the CEB. It is also unclear from where the Lanka Coal Company is going to get trained engineers and technical personnel to undertake a job of this nature."

He said that the Norochcholai power plant is a CEB owned power Station and there is no necessity have an outsider operate and maintain it when the CEB has enough capability to do so.

"If this company fails to maintain this USD 455 million Power plant those who made the decision to hand over the CEB project would be answerable for their short-sighted decision."

Power and Energy Minister W D J Seneviratne told The Island yesterday that there was no move to give operations and maintenance of Norchcholai Power Plant to Lanka Coal Company.

However, the CEBEU said that a statement purported to be made by the Secretary of the Ministry of Power and Energy had stated that the CEB's human resource capability to maintain the second and third stages of Norochcholai Power Plant will be reconsidered prior to handing over the operation and maintenance of the same to CEB.

The Secretary according to sources said the CEB's ability to pay back the loan for the second and third stages of Norochcholai will have be studied.
