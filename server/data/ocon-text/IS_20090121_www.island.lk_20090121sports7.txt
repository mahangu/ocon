NEW ORLEANS (AP) - Chris Paul capped a 27-point performance with an off-balance 3-pointer as time expired, lifting the New Orleans Hornets to a 103-100 victory over the Indiana Pacers on Monday.

Peja Stojakovic hit five 3-pointers and finished with a season-high 26 points for New Orleans. The Hornets started the game without David West (back) and lost center Tyson Chandler (left ankle) late in the second quarter.

At Boston, Rajon Rondo scored 23 points in the first three quarters, and Ray Allen scored 20 before sitting out the fourth.

Kevin Garnett had 16 points with eight rebounds, and Paul Pierce had 12 points with eight rebounds and eight assists to help Boston take a 64-34 halftime lead.

Shaquille O'Neal scored 16 with 11 rebounds for Phoenix, which had won seven of its last 10. Amare Stoudemire, the Suns' leading scorer, had just three points on 0-for-7 shooting. Knicks 102, Bulls 98

At New York, Chris Duhon scored with 31.2 seconds left to help the New York Knicks beat his former team Chicago.

Duhon, questionable with back spasms before the game, drove around two defenders to put the Knicks up 99-98. He then hit two free throws with 22.8 seconds remaining to extend the lead to three after Bulls rookie Derrick Rose missed on a drive.

At Charlotte, North Carolina, Tim Duncan blocked Raymond Felton's tying shot attempt in the frantic final seconds as San Antonio beat Charlotte.

Duncan had 17 points, 11 rebounds and six assists, and produced the game's biggest defensive play after his own shot was blocked by Emeka Okafor with 10 seconds left. Tony Parker added 13 points and 10 assists for the Spurs.

Raja Bell scored 25 points in his best offensive performance since being acquired by the Bobcats last month. Diaw added 16 points and 13 rebounds. Timberwolves 94, Clippers 86

At Los Angeles, Al Jefferson scored 20 points and tied a season high with 17 rebounds, and Craig Smith also had 20 points to lead Minnesota past the Los Angeles Clippers.

Corey Maggette scored 16 points for the Warriors, who had won three of four just once previously in their disappointing season. Golden State comfortably held off the Wizards, hitting 13 3-pointers and making 53 percent of its shots against Washington's sketchy defense.

Caron Butler, Antawn Jamison and Andray Blatche scored 22 points apiece for the Wizards, who lost for the seventh time in eight games.
