It gives me the utmost pleasure as the chief Basnayaka Nilame of the Kelaniya Rajamaha Viharaya to take this opportunity to express my heartiest and delightful views on the event of the Duruthu festival of the Kelaniya Rajamaha Viharaya.

Duruthu Maha Perahara, a cultural pageant is the main feature of the festivity, which has been held since 1927 in highest Honour by the overwhelmed Buddhists to commemorate the Buddha's first visit to Sri Lanka.

I am proud to note the excellent work in the installation of a gold railing, Ranveta, around the Bodhi terrace with the intention of invoking blessing on the armed forces and the nation. The concept of fixing of a gold plated Ranvata was initially mooted by the Army Commander of Sri Lanka, Lt, General Sarath Fonseka, and he was able to fulfill this noble task successfully with generous donations of armed forces.

From the days of the yore, kings queens, leaders and people have been venerating the sacred Bodhi tree with great piety, to receive blessings. Most Buddhists would never forget to spend few hours at the vicinity of the Bodhi Tree in meditation to cultivate a sense of calmness, in order to gain peace and happiness.
