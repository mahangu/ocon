Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse NewspapersA young female was injured when LTTE cadres indiscriminately fired at a group of civilians seeking protection with the Security Forces on Sunday in Puthukudiyiruppu.

Military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said 45 civilians fleeing from the grip of the Tigers had come under LTTE fire while they were making escape from the uncleared area on Sunday.

"A 17 year old female injured by the LTTE fire was treated at the Army medical corp before she was transfered to hospital," he added.

He said however, the fleeing civilians were rescued by the Army. "Troops of 8 SLLI (Sri Lanka Light Infantry) under Brigade 581 operating in the Puthukudiyiruppu east rescued civilians fleeing from the LTTE clutches".

The LTTE cadres are holding civilians as human shield to slow down the Security Forces humanitarian operation in the Vanni and liberate civilians.

He said over 40,000 displaced civilians arriving from the Vanni were resettled in the Vavuniya and Mannar IDP welfare centres.
