Do you think you are getting a great deal when you get bonus calls and cheap rates to phone each other. No â€“ it's only the advertisement that says so, But you are billed well over double even with the per second billing.

Have you ever tried timing your call and checking what you were charged, you will be surprised at what is happening.

A certain cellphone company was having a field day and making millions on calls. When they were intimidated, they quietly changed to the correct format. But this may be for a while. They could start again. Do not be brainwashed by ads on TV, radio etc. Spend a little time and time your calls once in a while, it will do you no harm. We folk fall for the perks offered. It is time we woke up not just call foolishly and be happy about it.
