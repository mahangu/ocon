Meanwhile, having realized the problems faced by the food processing sector, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce in consultation with the National Agribusiness Council and the Sri Lanka Food Processors Association took steps to publish a user friendly handbook titled 'GMP and HACCP', particularly focusing on the SME sector with funding from the European Commission under the Asia Invest Project "South Europe Meets South Asia, SEMSA."

This book was launched at the inauguration ceremony of SEMSA in February.

The Chamber hopes that this would help companies implement GMP, Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) and Food Safety Management Systems. This book is also available with the Foreign Trade and Information Division of the Chamber.
