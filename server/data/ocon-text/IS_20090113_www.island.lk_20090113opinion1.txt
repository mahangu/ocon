PMAL insists that the tusks of elephants are not teeth. PMAL should refer to any recognised dictionary (e.g Oxford , Cambridge or Webster's dictionary) which says that elephants tusks are two of its teeth. I contacted a very Senior Consultant Dental Surgeon who recently retired from the post of senior dental surgeon, Dental Institute, and who is now practicing in Borella. He told me that the tusks are the elephant's canine teeth. If PMAL contacts a first year dental student, he or she is sure to clear PMALdoubts.

His statement that I have advised readers to slaughter animals and eat meat is an untruth. Never in my life have I advised any person to slaughter any living being. Never in my life have I advised any person to consume flesh. PMAL gives the impression to the readers that Great King Devanampiyatissa who ruled the whole of Sri Lanka for more that 30 years was a non-vegetarian. I am not sure whether the above mentioned king consumed meat prior to the visit of Arhant Mahinda thero to Sri Lanka. But after the great king became a Buddhist following the visit of Arhant Mahinda Thero, he had been a complete vegetarian for the next 30 years. The great king using his regal powers had prohibited all his subjects. (i.e. Sinhalese) from killing animals. All his subjects had been vegetarians for the next 30 years.

It is common knowledge among students of history that all our Sinhala Kings prohibited the slaughter of cattle. Any person who had got caught consuming beef ('GERIMAS") were demoted to the lowest caste (Rodiya caste).
