Vote for President

says Janata Party President of India:

It is surprising that some representatives of the defunct LTTE terrorist floated Tamil National Alliance (TNA) are in India canvassing support of Tamils of India for General Sarath Fonseka, Janata Party President Dr. Subramaniam Swamy said.

He said in a statement: "No Indian concerned for the welfare of Tamils of Sri Lanka and their future can support any candidate who has on his side the LTTE stooge outfit the TNA which seeks a separate Eelam. Moreover, Gen. Fonseka is also at the same time supported by the hardliner anti-Tamil party, the JVP, which wants no concessions given for the Tamils.

Hence as President if elected, General Fonseka will be in constant dilemma on what to do. He will also have to legitimize the rump LTTE that is hiding a billion dollars of ill-gotten money for a come back. Tamils of Sri Lanka today need humane stability in governance after years of killing and dictatorship of the LTTE.

Hence I urge all Tamils of Sri Lanka that if they want Indian opinion on their side in the future, they must vote for the Tamil speaking Sinhala leader, Mahinda Rajapaksa, for President of Sri Lanka."
