All share up 3.87% & Milanka 4.42% on Rs. 245 mn. turnover Retail driven rally on CSE sustained for the second day

The rally on the Colombo bourse continued for the second day running with turnover at Rs.245 million, down from the previous day's Rs.263.9 million, and both indices maintaining their upward momentum â€“ the All Share rising by 67.32 points (3.87%) and the Milanka gaining 84.87 points (4.42%).

"The market was mainly retail driven with substantial interest in the blue chips," Prashan Fernando of Acuity Stockbrokers said. "The big trades were in Seylan (non-voting) which topped turnover yesterday, JKH, Royal Palms Beach Hotels, Commercial Bank, CTC and Maskeliya."

Brokers and analysts were non-committal on whether the rally will be sustained or whether profit taking would push down the indices.

"It is hard for retailers to sustain a rally like this and we have not yet seen very much institutional or high net worth interest," one broker said.

Seylan X trading between Rs.6.25 and Rs.6.75 gained 50 cents to close at Rs.6.75 generating Rs.34.5 million to turnover while JKH, on a trading range of Rs.71.25 to Rs.74.50, was up 75 cents to close at Rs.72 contributing Rs.21.4 million to turnover.

There was a crossing of 500,000 Royal Palm Beach Hotels at a 30 rupee price which brokers said appeared to be a related party transaction. There were six other trades of small parcels of this counter at prices between Rs.29.75 and Rs.30.25.

Commercial Bank continued to interest investors gaining Rs.3.75 on nearly 0.2 million shares traded between Rs.88 and Rs.93.

The high dividend paying Ceylon Tobacco saw over 0.1 million shares done at Rs.73 gaining a rupee to close at Rs.73 generating Rs.9.2 million to turnover.

"There was less activity in plantation stock at the beginning of the day but it picked up towards the close of trading," Fernando of Acuity said.

Yesterday's biggest plantation play was in Maskeliya where over 0.5 million shares were traded between Rs.17 and Rs.18 gaining one rupee to close at Rs.18.

Other blue chip gainers included SLT (up Rs.2 to close at Rs.36.50) and Dialog (up 50 cents to close at Rs.5.75) while DFCC gained Rs.4.75 to close at Rs.78.75 on 36,600 shares transacted.
