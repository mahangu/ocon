Nearly seventy per cent of Estate Tamils will back General (Rtd) Sarath Fonseka at this month's Presidential Election, former CWC National Organiser R. Yogarajan predicted yesterday.

Asked at a news conference in Colombo to state an approximate number of Estate Tamil votes, that he and former Deputy Education Minister N. Sachithanandan can deliver, Yogarajan said that it was not possible to give figures, but around 750,000 of the one million Estate Tamils will support Fonseka.

Yogarajan said he and Sachithanandan had decided to return to the UNP fold because they are convinced that Ranil Wickremesinghe was capable of ensuring equality for all communities in Sri Lanka.

"I have read every page of Mr.Wickremesinghe's book Anagathaya Abiyogaya.It sets out clearly the manner in which a new Sri Lanka can be created",he said "The road to creating an equal society,re-establishing democracy and good governnance,as stated in the book,lies in the election of General Fonseka as president."

Questioned as to why he and Sachinathanandan joined the Rajapaksa government, if Wickremesinghe had the solutions,Yogarajan said that as a member of the CWC,he went along with the party's decision then."There was a struggle between my party loyalty and conscience.My conscience has prevailed."

Responding to government claims,that there would be confusion in the minds of Estate Tamils between the "Elephant" and "Swan" symbols,he said that those who say such things were insulting their intelligence.

"Estate Tamils are politically mature and fully aware of developments in the country.They will vote for the Swan symbol and ensure General Fonseka's victory on January 26."
