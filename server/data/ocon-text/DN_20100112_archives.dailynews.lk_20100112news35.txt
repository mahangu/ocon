First ever SRU at full swing

The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC ) is operating its first ever Special Response Unit (SRU) of the Fire Services Department in a new building at Roxy Garden, Wellawatta from yesterday.

The new building constructed at a cost Rs 40 million was opened by Netherlands Ambassador Leoni Cuelenaere.

Addressing the opening ceremony, Local Government and Provincial Councils Secretary Casion Herath said a number of foreign funded projects had been implemented for the benefit of Local Authorities and Provincial Councils to uplift their capabilities in the utility and emergency services needed by the public.

Commenting on the political attitude of the people towards the work of local bodies, he said existing different political views in society could be removed only by providing a better service through the political leadership of the country.

The Fire Service Department of CMC is rendering a significant service to the country protecting lives and properties.

Netherlands Ambassador Leoni Cuelenaere said Sri Lanka Fire Fighters can now gain better opportunities in enhancing their knowledge of latest techniques of emergency services through the specialized training experienced in the Netherlands with the launch of this project.

She said the new unit will serve to save lives and material damage through an effective and efficient mechanism in disaster management.

She said she was happy to note that training and all the equipment for SPR have been provided with the support of the Netherland Government.
