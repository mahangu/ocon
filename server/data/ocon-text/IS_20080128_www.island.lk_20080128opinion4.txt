On the day of this tragedy, my eldest daughter rushed for the earlier train, and made her way home safely.

When she got off the train and was walking up the Angulana station Rd. We herd the sound of the blast, but we didn't know what it was.

Then people were getting restless and we were told what had happened. My eldest daughter because she had taken an earlier train, but we couldn't save her from a terminal illness, which took her away from us.

On an earlier occasion my daughter fell between the platform and a train. People shouted and pulled her off the track and my daughter's life was saved them.

My second daughter who also used to travel by the same train that was bombed, was fortunate enough to be at home that day as she was receiving treatment for an eye injury.

As a result, my second daughter, too, escaped the train blast.

I pray daily to our Lord for guidance and safety of our family and all others.
