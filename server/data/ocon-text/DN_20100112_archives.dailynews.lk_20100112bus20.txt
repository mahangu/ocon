Jaffna farmers upbeat

Charumini de Silva in Jaffna

Jaffna is a very rich district filled with both natural and human resources. The district has the finest soil that could be found in the country. Neerveli in Jaffna has a low population of 150 to 200 and has one of the richest soils that could cultivate any type of fruit or vegetable. The people living in this area are dependent on farming.

"I have been farming onion, grapes, papaya, chillie and banana for the past 20 years continuously. The taxes which we had to pay during those days were much high compared to the current taxes. With the dawn of peace the tax has reduced drastically.

The main challenges these farmers face are that during the drought it is difficult to find water, for them to continue their farming and they suggest the authorized Government institutions to provide deep wells or a water pumping system as a solution.

Access to credit out of the town is comparatively less and the farmers anticipate more development banks in the rural areas, he said.

Chandrakumar said that the cost of labour is Rs 550 per day and that it is too much for a small farmer to afford.

This is mainly because the farmers do not want their children to involve in the agricultural sector as they think it is not a reputed line of business.

"We require more advice, technology assistance, fertilizer subsidies, market access from the agriculture related Government institutions as we expect to expand our business while contributing to a higher portion in the agricultural sector of the country's GDP", he said.

He said that the dawn of peace was a dream coming true and that is what matters for them most.

The Vaddikkili Vasantham (Uthuru Wasanthaya) development program has done major infrastructure developments such as roads, electricity, water and setting up other essential services in the Northern province. This program was launched by the Government a few months ago.
