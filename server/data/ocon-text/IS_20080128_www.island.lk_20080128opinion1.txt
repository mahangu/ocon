Abductions, disappearances, white vans, black coloured number plate-less cabs with four or five men in civvies on the Colombo-Negombo Road, mutilated bodies, cold blooded murder, 'Dr Ministers' and goons storming media institutions, parliamentarians being gunned down in broad daylight etc., remind me of an incident, which I wish to share with our readers.

That happened somewhere in 1988 or '99, during the days when Sri Lanka became a veritable killing field.

My father, the late Sydney Palipane (formerly of the Sri Lanka Police), was residing at Tammita, Makewita, which is approximately 8 kms from Ja-Ela.

My wife, my daughter I went to spend the night with my father one day.

Our house is located right at Tammita Junction and if one approaches from Kehelbaddara, it's all downhill for a number of metres.

All the doors were closed as were the windows. Then we heard a vehicle go past our place. My father opened one of the windows and then quickly closed it.

A few minute later someone shouted "gettuwa arrinna", (open the gate). My father opened a side door and walked out followed by me, my daughter and wife.

So did our pet dogs, Flash and Trigger.

"Api PRRA ekeng, gettuwa arrinna," bellowed a black clad figure who was at the gate.

We did not open the gate, so he vaulted over it and came towards us.

One of the dogs charged at the ominous looking man, who had an automatic weapon in his hand.

Bang!

We were not frightened but definitely concerned. We thought he had shot the dog, but no, he had only fired to stop being mauled by either Trigger of Flash.

It seems the man was a dog lover.

He walked up to us, unfurled a poster and told my dad to paste it on the wall of the boutique, right in front of our house.

He threatened us with dire consequences if the deed was not done.

Then the vehicle, some other black clad figures and the 'kind-hearted dog loving gentleman' vanished into the night.
