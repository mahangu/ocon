The UPFA candidates can go to the masses without any hesitation, because the UPFA has implemented a large number of development projects for the benefit of the people.

This is the only country that has an Opposition Leader who is supposed to serve the people had written to an international bank not to provide credit facilities to the Government for the continuation of development work. The Government will not hesitate to face any kind of election at any time as people have placed their faith in the Government. Election is a yardstick by which people's wish is tested" she added.
