The Island-SportsKarachi: Sri Lanka will split its tour of Pakistan to accommodate a hastily-scheduled one-day series against India next month, sources said here on Sunday.

Sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said talks were on to work out an arrangement under which Sri Lanka will tour Pakistan in the third week this month to first play five one-day internationals and a Twenty20 match.

It would then return for the one-day series against India and complete it by February 18 before coming back to play three Tests here.

"Obviously both the Pakistan and Sri Lankan boards want to make money out of their series and it is understandable the Lankans are keen to not lose the opportunity of playing against India," a PCB source said.

"We are discussing the possibility of playing a short series against Sri Lanka, a top BCCI official said.

Sri Lanka's Sports Minister Gamini Lokuge has also confirmed that he was discussing the series with the BCCI.
