Wimal challenges again

Hiran H. Seneviratne

National Freedom Front Chairman Wimal Weerawansa called upon New Democratic Front Presidential candidate Sarath Fonseka or any nominee of his within the next 48 hours for a live television debate in any private channel to disprove his son-in-law's alleged arm deals.

Fonseka held the post of Army Commander for four years and during that period he had purchased arms and military hardware through a company registered in USA belonging to his son-in-law, Weerawansa said. Weerawansa said he has ample documentary proof with all facts and figures on these deals carried out by Fonseka's son-in-law.

He said the address in the US Green Card and the son-in-law's company address is similar and he had misled the US Government as well. The Army Commander placed orders for purchase and procurement of arms and military hardware up to US$ 25 million and these dealings were done through his son-in-law's company registered in USA, Weerawansa alleged.

Therefore, this is a golden opportunity for him to prove his cleanliness and transparency before the Presidential election, he said.

Weerawansa also said that the Sunday Leader Editor has also replied well to JVP MP Lal Kantha's challenge on Fonseka's controversial statement to their Sunday newspaper and that itself indicates that he challenged without any proof.

Engineering Services and Construction Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratna said that every citizen should be grateful to President Mahinda Rajapaksa for ending the three decade war. During his four year period, the President launched massive development projects and provided a large number of employment.

Minister Senaratna said upto 2006, the Chief of Defence Staff was the head of the tender board on purchasing and procurement of arms and military hardware into the country and Fonseka's son-in-law paid all taxes to the US Government under his name on these arms purchasing and procurement.
