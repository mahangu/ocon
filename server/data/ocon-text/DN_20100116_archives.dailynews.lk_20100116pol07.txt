UNP Organizer for the Kegalle electorate and former Chairman of the Kegalle UC Rukantha Perera said he has renounced his posts in the UNP and joined the SLFP to support President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the forthcoming election as a mark of gratitude for the President for eliminating the scourge of terrorism through his astute leadership.

Perera said this addressing a meeting of the Polonnaruwa District SLFP Women's Organization held at the Pulathisi Buddhi Mandiraya in Polonnaruwa on Wednesday. Agricultural Development and Agrarian Services Minister Maithripala Sirisena presied.

Perera said the President is a courageous leader who never succumbed to the pressure exerted by external forces who wanted to give a breathing space for the LTTE calling for an immediate halt to the Security Forces' operations. While managing a costly war he never neglected national development.

There was food aplenty and no one died of hunger during the war as there was sound economic management. This was ample testimony to the President's farsighted leadership.

Recalling a visit made by Opposition Candidate Sarath Fonseka to his residence in Kegalle recently Perera said that Fonseka wanted him to spread false rumours as much as possible through short mobile messages to deceive the masses in order to defeat the President. This showed that Fonseka's election campaign was based on false rumours. In spite of such conspiracies President Mahinda Rajapaksa would be definitely reelected once again by a vast majority of people on January 26, he said.

Southern Province Governor Kumari Balasuriya, Provincial Council Member Peshala Jayawardena, Chandrika de Zoysa of the All Ceylon SLFP Women's Organization and several others also spoke.
