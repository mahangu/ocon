THe Commissioner General of Prisons, Major General (rtd.) Vajira Wijegunawardena said he had requested for 2,000 acres of land in Horowpatana from Minister of Nation Building S. M. Chandrasena to make prisoners more productive.

He said that since there was no solution in sight for the problem of congestion in Prisons, he had sought the land so that prisoners could also be involved in the government's 'Api Wavamu Rata Nagamu' programme.

He said that he had a major problem on his hands as prison congestion was almost at breaking point with the already over strained prison guards having to control several hundred dangerous criminals who had been condemned to death but whose sentences were commuted to life.

He said he was happy that his appeals to the government on staff shortage did not go unheeded and he was able to recruit 750 Prison guards who were being trained at camps in Welikande, Embilipitiya and Balangoda.

The British had constructed all Prisons on acres of prime commercial land in major towns and the Government had okayed the moving of the Bogambara prison, which was situated on 25 acres of prime commercial land in Kandy town, to Pallekele.

Work has started on the new prison on 45 acres of land adjoining the open Prison camp at Pallekele at a cost of Rs 1.9 billion and is to be completed in two years so that 2,100 prisoners could be moved there from Bogambara.

"We are continuing with meditation programmes for long term prisoners and are to commence the new concept of 'Bandanagarayen Gamata' under which we expect to take hard core criminals to various schools and institutions and get them to confess about the evils of crime which had led them to prison thus ruining their families and their own lives".

He said at present the Prisons Department was assisting the Government's "Api Wavamu Ratanagamu" program by having prisoners cultivate 200 acres of land in the Homagama, Watareka, Boralesgamuwa,Ratnapura, Mahara, Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa areas.
