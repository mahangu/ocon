Klitschko to defend titles against Chambers

World heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko will defend his IBF, WBO and IBO titles against mandatory challenger Eddie Chambers in Dusseldorf on March 20, it was announced on Monday.

Klitschko, 33, will fight Chambers at the home of current Bundesliga leaders Leverkusen which will have an expected capacity of 51,000 for the fight.

The Ukrainian's last bout saw him stop Ruslan Chagaev in the ninth round at Schalke 04's Veltins Arena in Gelsenkirchen last June and Klitschko said he was looking forward to facing Chambers in another football stadium.

"The fight will take place in a gigantic stadium and I am already looking forward to the backdrop - it will give me an additional kick," said Klitschko.

This will be Klitschko's fifth defence of both his WBO and IBF title and the champion says he will not take Chambers lightly.

"Chambers is clearly the best current American heavyweight and there is a good reason why he is number one in the rankings," said Klitschko whose record includes 53 victories, 47 knock-outs and three defeats.

The 27-year-old Chambers won the chance to face Klitschko when he won the eliminator against Alexander Dimitrenko last summer and says he expects to surprise the champion.

"I worked hard to get this shot at the title," said Chambers, who has 35 victories with 18 knock-outs plus one defeat, on his record.

"I plan on surprising Klitschko just like I surprised Dimitrenko and I want his three belts.
