TALLAHASSEE, Florida (AP) - A Florida lawmaker is calling for an investigation into who phoned a hot line claiming Tiger Woods' children were being abused.

The anonymous accusation last month was quickly rejected by Florida officials. But Republican state Sen. Ronda Storms wants officials, if possible, to prosecute the person.

A Department of Children and Families spokesman said Monday that a false report is difficult to prove unless the person confesses, but it can result in civil or criminal penalties.

"False reporting is a very serious offense and takes precious time away from vulnerable citizens who truly need protection," spokesman Joe Follick said. "It is a crime and a frustration to the investigator and healthy families."

Woods has not been seen in public since Thanksgiving, when he was in an accident near his home in the exclusive, gated community of Windermere in an Orlando suburb. He announced on his Web site Dec. 10 that he was taking an indefinite leave of absence from the PGA Tour to focus on repairing his marriage after admitting his infidelity.
