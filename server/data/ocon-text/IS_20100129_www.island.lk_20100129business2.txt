While the government claims of ample stocks, increases in food prices saw inflation jump to 6.5 percent in the first month of 2010 while the Central Bank predicts it would remain 'benign' and in single digit levels throughout the year.

The point-to-point change in the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) increased to 6.5 percent this month after recording a low 0.7 percent in September 2009 and gradually increasing since then to 4.8 percent in December.

According to the Department of Census and Statistics, the rise in inflation was largely due an increase in prices of food during the month.

All varieties of rice captured in basket of good comprising the CCPI recorded increases ranging from 14.38 percent and 18.63 percent from December price levels and 12.31 percent to 18.63 percent from January 2009.

Wheat flour, bread, eggs, onions and potatoes declined in price from December 2009, ranging from 1.11 percent and 25.55 percent, only wheat flour and dhal recorded price levels lower than they were in January 2009.

Most other items on the food basket recorded increases in price levels in January 2010 as against December 2009 and January 2009; overall food prices increased by 4 percent year-on-year while increasing 0.75 percent from December 2009, according to Department of Census and Statistics.

The Central Bank in its Monetary Policy Review earlier this month said inflation is expected to remain benign and in single digit levels throughout this year. Thus, it kept its policy rates unmoved at current low levels. But Benchmark Treasury bill rates have been inching upward since last November.

The12-month moving average rate of inflation, however, stood at 3.1 percent in January 2010. Rs. 1.9 bn. turnover, indices up sharply
