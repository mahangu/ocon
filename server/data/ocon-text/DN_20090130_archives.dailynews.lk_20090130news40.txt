The UPFA led Council was successful in carring out a smooth council during the past five years, even though the two opposition parties have a majority if they work together, said Western Province Chief Minister Reginald Cooray.

The support given by the opposition parties in this regard should be greatly appreciated, the Chief Minister added.

He was speaking at a ceremony organised recently to introduce the new regulations for Urban Solid Waste Management of the Western Provincial Council, (WPC).

For Making the Waste Management process of the Province a reality, 70 Waste Management Regulations named as "No. 01 of 2008 Urban Solid Waste Management Regulations" have been introduced by the Western Provincial Council, Chief Minister Cooray said.

The above regulations were gazetted in the Extraordinary Gazette No. 1560/6 dated July 29, 2008. The WPC was the first Provincial Council to achieve this target. Other Provinces are yet to establish it, Cooray said.

Implements and accessories worth around Rs. 100 million were distributed to support the Waste Management of the local bodies in the Western Province from the allocation of 2008.

Tractors, Trailers, Hand Carts and garbage collection bins were distributed to some local bodies of the Western Province from this initial grant.
