The Island-OpinionI refer to the letter of Mr. M. Riyal of Puttalam in the opinion/letter column of the Island of the 2nd instant.

I have no axe to grind with anyone as I have been apolitical through out (I am a septuagenarian) and in this instance I would like to contribute my two cents worth in regard to the query raised by the writer.

Apparently he has got his wires crossed and is sadly labouring under a delusion. Messrs. Dallas Alahapperuma and Basil Rajapaksa may have acquired American citizenship, but there is nothing to prevent them obtaining dual citizenship in Sri Lanka, which would restore to them their original status in their land of birth. It is general knowledge and no constitutional authority is needed to express expert opinion.

President Mahinda Rajapaksa surely would not have appointed them to their respective responsible positions if there was any constitutional impediment.
