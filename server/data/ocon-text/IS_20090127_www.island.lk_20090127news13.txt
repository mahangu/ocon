The century-old Godakumbura bridge of Beliatta constructed in 1907 on the direction of the legendary Government Agent of Hambantota Leonard Woolf is in a deplorable state and has been closed for vehicular traffic for the last three weeks.

The twelve-foot wide bridge built almost a hundred years ago on Dry-stones is sinking as it is not strong enough to cope with the large number of vehicles including heavy machinery passing over the bridge the Tangalla R. D. A. Chief Engineer H. B. A. Nayanananda told The Island.

A temporary bridge is now being built until a permanent one is constructed.

Due to the temporary closure of the bridge all vehicles that were to use the bridge have been diverted from Dedduwawala via Puwakdandawa, Palapotha and Unana to Beliatta and vice versa. As a result of the temporary closure of Godakumbura bridge long distance buses from Matara to Moneragala, Kataragama, Nuwara Eliya etc., are going via Mahaweli to those destinations. People of all walks of life - students, teachers, government servants and other - are adversely affected as they have to take a longer route to get to their destination.

The history of the Godakumbura bridge came to light from the notes of the diary that had been maintained by the G. A. cum Judge Leonard Woolf during his administration.

His notes divulged that he himself had taken part in laying the first dry-stone to construct the bridge and on the same day leonard woolf had laid the foundation for a 20 X 100 first market building which existed till the end of last year until it was demolished to construct a two storeyed market building.
