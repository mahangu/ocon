Mukherjee's visit strengthened ties

The friendship and cordial relationship between Sri Lanka and India further strengthened with the visit of Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee. His visit was another official event between the two countries under the bilateral exchange of ministers and officials, Information and Media Minister and Cabinet Spokesman Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said.

Minister Yapa was addressing the weekly Cabinet press briefing at the Government Information Department Auditorium yesterday. He said the two countries have already agreed to crush terrorism.

Healthcare and Nutrition Minister and Leader of the House Nimal Siripala de Silva said the Indian Minister's visit was not something that took place suddenly.

It was another event that took place according to bilateral ties between the two countries. India, Sri Lanka and other SAARC countries signed an agreement to crush terrorism during the previous SAARC Summit in Colombo. "The following day of the Mumbai attack, I visited India. The need to crush terrorism was re-confirmed after that attack and I personally experienced it," he said.

President Mahinda Rajapaksa explained to Minister Mukherjee about the ground situation of Mullaitivu.

India is going to face an election soon and various political parties in India are trying their best to take political advantages from the situation. The present sensitive political atmosphere of India is one of the main concerns of the Indian Government, he added. NG
