MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) â€” Andy Roddick is laughing off a loss to Serena Williams, saying that it came 16 years ago when he was a skinny 10-year-old and she was "bench-pressing dump trucks."

Williams said earlier this week that her triumph over Roddick when they were preteens training together in Florida is one of her greatest wins. Though she was clearly having fun at Roddick's expense, she's proud enough of the victory to mention it on her Web site.

"Any chance she gets, she just does it to get under my skin, and she does it very successfully," said Roddick, who has advanced to the Australian Open quarterfinals after a fourth-round win Sunday. "She forgets to mention that it was 1993."

He said they laughed about it on court Saturday as Williams sat him down to list the male players she claims to have indirectly beaten by having bested Roddick.

But he complained that the game wasn't fair.

"When we were 10, I had to literally run around in the shower to get wet," he said. "She was bench-pressing dump trucks already at that time."

Roddick also disputed Williams' recollection of the score, which she says was 6-1.

"She's good at not letting the truth get in the way of a good story sometimes," he said, smiling. "I think it was 6-4."

He said he never played against Williams' older sister, Venus, because she was "way too good." He is proud of the success they have enjoyed since their years training in Delray Beach, Fla.

"We just spent hours and hours out there just playing," Roddick said. "We all have done pretty well, and all three of those little kids out there got to No. 1, which is pretty cool."
