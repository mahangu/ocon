National Crafts Council (NCC) predicts 2008 will be a good year for the local handicrafts industry with the increased promotional activities across the island, plus the expected increase in the Tourism industry.

"We have planned a number of trade fairs and exhibitions in different parts of the country in order to raise awareness levels and to market the products. The promotional activities that we carried out last year highly impacted on locals into buy indigenous products. With the planned programmes for this year, we can expect a good era for the local handicrafts industry," said NCC Chairman Buddhi Keerthisena.

Keerthisena said that plans are underway to train the handicraft producers correctly on producing high demand products.NCC would take over the training unit of Laksala in order to train producers.

"This is a new project planned for 2008. Most handicrafts producers fail to sell their product because they are not up to required standards. Some of them do not know of basic market demands. Our mission is to train them on quality production and find them the market- place," said Keerthisena.

He added that the Sigiriya Handicrafts Village Project is also expected to become operational this year. The Village will be provided with the required facilities in order to convert it to a tourist destination.

"Rs.4 million has been allocated for the purpose and the NCC will partner the Sri Lanka Hotel Corporation to achieve the objective. The Village will soon include a luxury restaurant, vehicle parking area and a handicrafts museum.

"Sigiriya is visited by a large number of local and foreign visitors annually. Upgrading the quality of the Handicrafts Village will not only promote the area as a tourist destination, but also open up an abundance of marketing opportunities to local handicraft producers," said an optimistic Keerthisena.
