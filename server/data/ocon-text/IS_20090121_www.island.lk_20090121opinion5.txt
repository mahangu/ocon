It is a widely acknowledged and known fact that bribery is rampant in our little paradise isle. There is absolutely nothing that one could get done from a Government Department, Institute, Corporation or Board or any Local Government Body without having to oil somebody's palm. This is not only a very pathetic situation, but also a very dangerous trend. No government will ever be able to win the hearts of the masses as long as this ugly practice is allowed to continue unabated. Everybody from the top to the bottom - politicians, top bureaucrats; middle and lower level officers; peons and labourers are all in the game. There are instances when a 'Public Servant' openly asks for a bribe without any fear or shame and sometimes they even threaten the poor citizen of dire consequences unless they are 'looked after'.

Most unfortunately this dirty practice is now slowly, but steadily creeping into the private Sector, too - specially private hospitals. When, and how is this cancer going to be cured? "The sharks get away whilst the sprats get caught" the people say, whenever a policeman, grama niladari or a petty clerk is arrested for such a crime. The Department to Investigate Bribery & Corruption in the Public Sector is not as active as envisaged. It was reported that hundreds of files are stacked up - whilst only a handful have been investigated. Even such investigations so far have failed to produce results.

Can a country prosper when bribery and corruption is allowed to flourish? All credit to the MR government for not only eradicating terrorism from our land - but also for having shown the world how to tackle global terrorism. Similarly credit would be due to the MR government if he can crack down hard on politicians, the bureaucracy and completely cure the public sector of this menacing cancer â€“ bribery and corruption.
