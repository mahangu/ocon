NewsPolice in London say they are investigating an arson attack on a Sri Lankan Buddhist temple in north London.

 Chief Incumbent of London's Sri Saddhatissa Buddhist Vihara, in Kingsbury, Galayaye Piyadassi Thera told BBC Sandeshaya that he suspects Tamil Tigers for the attack. 



 A spokesman for Scotland Yard Police, however, refused to comment on the accusation.

 A group of attackers have broken the windows and set fire to the temple, Piyadassi Thera said, but fled away as they themselves got caught in the fire. 



 "Fortunately the fire did not spread inside in to the temple," Galayaye Piyadassi Thera told BBC Sinhala service.

 He added that it was the sixth such attack on the temple in recent times.

 Some vehicles were damaged in an attack on September 26; Sri Lankan and Buddhists flags that were hoisted in front of the temple were also removed in other attacks. 



 A special puja has been organised in the temple on Saturday evening to invoke blessings to Sri Lankan troops that captured Kilinochchi from the LTTE on Friday. 

 Piyadassi Thera said it might have been the reason for the attack, which was recorded in CCTV cameras. 

 London Police told BBC Sandeshaya that investigations are underway.
