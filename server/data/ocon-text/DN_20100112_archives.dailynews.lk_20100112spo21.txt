Dinesh Sanjeewa will lead CH and FC

The Colombo Hockey and Football Club which failed to live upto expectations last year by finishing fourth in the Caltex 'A' Division League are determined to give a much better performance this year.

The lads from Maitland Crescent came up with a gallant display against the mighty Kandy SC and went down fighting in both matches, but they suffered three morale-shattering defeats at the hands of Army (12-21) and Navy (12-18 and 14-20) which resulted in them clipping into fourth position despite registering some impressive wins over Havelocks, Police, Air Force and Army (in the return game).

CH and FC will once again field a formidable pack. They will be led by Sri Lanka second row forward Dinesh Sanjeewa, a superb line out jumper and a tireless player in the loose.

He will have the services of some excellent forwards in Jayantha Ranaweera, Achala Perera, Sathya Ranatunga, Wasamba Senarath, Dilanka Wijesekera, Senthil Kumar and Zaffer Jahn (who has rejoined the club having turned out for Kandy SC last year) despite two key players Bilal Hassen and Sharo Fernando crossing over to CR and FC.

CH and FC has been let down by their three quarters during the last three years. Scrum half Tuan Shamrock who was injured in the Mercantle Sevens has recovered from his injury and is expected to pair off with either Sajith Bandara or Omar Hassen.

The back division will also have the services of players of the calibre of ex-Sri Lanka Skipper Sajith Mallikarachchi, Shane Dissanayake, Ruchira Fernando, Indika Udayakumara Sri Lanka Winger Lakala Perera and veteran Milinda Jayasinghe.

With Australian Coach Divid Edwards having left midway during the season last year former CH Skipper Tony Amith has been entrusted with task of coaching the club this year.

Amit, a coach with a proven track record should be able to mould them into a formidable outfit with the assistance of former Sri Lanka Winger Intlishan Marikar.
