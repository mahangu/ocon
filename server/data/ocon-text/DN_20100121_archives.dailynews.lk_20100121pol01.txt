Defeat secret pact

Rasika Somarathna

*Give verdict against betrayal

*Will never allow rebirth of LTTE

President Mahinda Rajapaksa on Tuesday emphasized that he would never allow the subjugation of the freedom achieved and the democracy protected by sacrificing thousands of precious lives. Speaking at a massive public rally in Polonnaruwa attended by an estimated crowd of over 100,000, President Rajapaksa said that he was confident that the people would rise against such attempts and would never allow the ugly head of terrorism to rise again or attempts to divide the country.

He told the gathering that another secret pact, hatched with the intention of propagating divisions within the country was afoot and that it should be nullified at the January 26 elections.

While charging that elements who failed to divide the country through military means today were striving to win over their desired objectives in some other forms, the President cautioned the masses to be aware of such conspiracies. It is also the duty of all people to defeat such treacherous treaties, he added. He emphasized that supporting such moves would amount to a betrayal of the country and urged the public to give a proper reply to such sinister moves through their verdict at the January 26 elections.

The President also stressed that he would not allow any force to revitalize the LTTE on this soil in the future.

"In addition to defeating terrorism we also launched massive development programs throughout the country.

"In the not too distant future both present and future generation would reap the benefits of this massive development drive.

"Today some elements who have scented imminent defeat are trying to sow seeds of hatred and violence within the country.

"Without falling prey to such attempts join me to build on the hard earned victory and take the country towards a brighter future," he added.
