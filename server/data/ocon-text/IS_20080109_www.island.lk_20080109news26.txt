A bomb placed in a public telephone booth near the Regent Flats in the Fort exploded yesterday at 7.50 pm, about six minutes after Airforce Commander Air Marshal Roshan Goonetileke's motorcade passed the spot.

Although the blast caused panic in the City, police said that only one person suffered injuries.

A senior military official said that the bomb was not intended for any particular target. A vehicle belonging to DHL has been slightly damaged in the blast.
