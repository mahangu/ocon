The comic, a special bonus story in Marvel's Amazing Spider-Man #583, starts with Spider-Man's alter-ego Peter Parker taking photographs at the inauguration, before spotting two identical Obamas.

Parker decides "the future president's gonna need Spider-Man" and springs into action, using basketball, another passion of Mr Obama's, to determine the real Mr Obama and knocking out the impostor.

Mr Obama thanks him with a fist-bump. Last June, Fox News television presenter E.D. Hill was taken off the air after she accused Mr Obama and his wife Michelle of greeting each other with a "terrorist's fist jab".

Joe Quesada, Marvel's editor-in-chief, said Marvel Comics wanted to give him a "shout-out back" by featuring him in a bonus story after the President-Elect said he had collected Spider-Man comics as a child.

"How great is that? The commander-in-chief to be is actually a nerd-in-chief," Quesada said. "It was really, really cool to see that we had a geek in the White House. We're all thrilled with that."

Mr Quesada added that Marvel comics had featured most presidents, but generally in walk-on roles.

He added: "I think President Nixon might have appeared on the cover, but not in a good way."

Obama has said that as a child, he collected Spider-Man and Conan the Barbarian comic books. His Senate website used to have a photo of him posing in front of a Superman statue.

Last year, comedian Stephen Colbert, who hosts a spoof talk show The Colbert Report appeared in the comic series.
