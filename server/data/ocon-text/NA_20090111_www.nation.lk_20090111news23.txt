 The introduction of the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau (SLBFE) Amendment Act has been further delayed by the Legal Draftsmen's Department.



 According to FEB Chairman, Kingsley Ranawaka, the Bureau has sent the amendments of the Foreign Employment Bureau Act to the Legal Draftsmen's Department last August. However, until the present date it has not received any response from the Department.



 "We have not received the amended Act from the Legal Draftsmen's Department. We also need to go through the amendments and double check them," he said.



 He explained that due to the delay in the Legal Draftsmen's Department, the Bureau was unable to give an exact date when the Act will be presented to the Parliament.



 "The scope of the amendment is high. I presume it is due to that reason the Department is delaying it. They need to examine each section very carefully. There are amendments to the penal section, and to the registration of persons," he said.

 According to Ranawaka, the Act is being amended for the purpose of stopping the illegal foreign employment agencies islandwide.



 He explained that the fines totalling Rs. 200,000 and prison sentences up to two years were in the scheduled amendments, as job agents were found to be taking the present penalties lightly. 

 Ranawaka noted that through the new amendments, the Bureau will have more power to curtail illegal migrations and foreign employment.
