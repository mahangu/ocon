The Government has commenced a program to rehabilitate by-roads in the Dambulla electorate under the Jathika Sawiya and Maga Neguma development drives, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Janaka Bandara Thennakoon said.

Sixteen by-roads in Dambulla, 26 by-roads in Galewela, six by-roads in the Pallepola local bodies will be gravelled and concreted under this project. Immediate action to the release of Rs. 12 million for the above projects has been made by the Minister of Nation Building S.M. Chandrasena on the request of Minister Thennakoon.

According to sources a majority of the people who cultivate vegetables in the above villages face difficulties in transporting their produce to the Dambulla Economic Centre. The poor state of roads is also causing great difficulties to school children.
