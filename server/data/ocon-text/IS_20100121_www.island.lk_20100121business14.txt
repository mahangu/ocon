The kick-off of the "The happy life" project which provides information and consultancy services pertaining to procreative health using ICT took place recently.

The project is being implemented by the Sri Lanka Family Planning Association (FPA) under the guidance of the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA). Anyone could avail himself / herself of the services under this project through internet (website www.happylife.lk ), SMS, e-mail, chat, skype or telephone.

A special aspect of this project is that the information and services provided are tailor-made to the requirements of the customer/inquirer whether he /she be a mother, father, young man, young woman or member of any other category. Another specialty of the project is that while the relevant information services are provided by doctors with special knowledge in the field of procreative health these services and information could be obtained in English, Sinhala or Tamil as well.

One of the facilities available under this project is that anyone could quickly come to know the address and telephone numbers of the relevant Government hospitals and clinics.

The launch of this project took place under the patronage of Science and Technology Minister Professor Tissa Vitharana at the BMICH in Colombo recently.

On this occasion, Minister Professor Tissa Vitharana stated that it was very important that a project like this using ICT has been introduced and that the contribution of ICTA towards this project was highly commendable.

FPA Executive Director Gamini Wanasekera thanked ICTA for providing technical and financial support for this project through its e-society development initiative programme. He said that without the support and guidance given by ICTA this project would not have become a reality.
