The Central Bank has released the Directions on Maintenance of Capital Adequacy Ratios under the BASEL II for Licensed Commercial Banks and Licensed Specialised Banks in terms of the provisions under Section 46(1) and 76J(1), respectively, of the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988. These Directions will come into effect from January 1, 2008.

The "International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards" widely known as Basel II, issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), provides several options for adopting these capital standards. As an initial step towards adopting Basel II, it has been decided to begin with the simpler approach available, and to move to advanced approaches in the medium term, having regard to the preparedness of the banking system. Accordingly, all Licensed Commercial Banks and all Licensed Specialised Banks are required to apply the Standardised Approach for credit risk, the Standardised Measurement Method for market risk and the Basic Indicator Approach for operational risk, in computing the capital requirement from January 1, 2008.

This new framework is intended to improve the safety and soundness of the banking system by aligning capital adequacy assessment more closely with the underlying main risks, comprising credit risk, market risk and operational risks in banks. It is also intended to provide banking institutions with stronger incentives to improve risk measurement and management and allow complementary use of market mechanisms to have a greater accountability to other stakeholders of banks.
