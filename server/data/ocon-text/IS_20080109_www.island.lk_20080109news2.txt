JVP Parliamentary Group Leader Wimal Weerawansa yesterday thanked the Government for abrogating the cease fire agreement.

The UNF Government had entered into the agreement with the LTTE without showing a copy of the agreement to the Cabinet of ministers, the Executive President or other stakeholders, he said.

Right from the beginning, the JVP had rejected this agreement and showed on numerous occasions that it would not bring any political or economic dividends favourable to the country, he said.

"But some had depicted the agreement as a panacea for all ills. Some said the economy of this country had gained and went to the extent of claiming that Buddhists had been able to worship at the Somawathie Chaitiya thanks to the agreement entered into between the UNF Government and the LTTE. The biggest joke, as now we can see, is that none of these so called gains were new and nothing positive had been achieved through this move," he said.

"The agreement gave legal recognition to a terrorist outfit, which in return had been able to eliminate their political enemies as well a large number of security force personnel. A large number of camps of the security forces had been withdrawn and the troops were confined to their camps. The LTTE had been given space and freedom to set up a large number of camps around the Trincomalee Harbour. It was strengthened in all aspects thanks the ceasefire agreement. The ceasefire agreement should have been dumped years ago. The Government has taken a wise decision to abrogate it. Now we could say that it's better late than never," he said.
