In protesting against what they term as immature treatment for highly esteemed profession by the Minister, the Government Medical Officers' Association will stage a one day token strike on Friday covering the entire country. Emergency services will however continue unaffected, the GMOA said.

The main grievance of the Association is the lack of a proper salary structure and inadequate transport allowance. The other question in issue is the Minister's ruling on the use of generic terms in prescriptions.

Issuing medicinal drugs by generic name, is not possible in every instance. Dr. Padeniya said that the country is flooded with trade name drugs which are well- known and accepted, imported with the blessings of the Health Ministry.

"The Health Minister is seeking cheap popularity and in the process subjects medical officers to much hardship as some of his instructions could not be adhered and are not practical", GMOA Secretary Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya said at a press conference yesterday.

Prescribing drugs by generic name will make the patient vulnerable as he will not be able to decide otherwise when that particular drug is not available.

Concerted action is needed to correct this situation and the public should be aware of the consequences of wrong policy decisions, he added.
