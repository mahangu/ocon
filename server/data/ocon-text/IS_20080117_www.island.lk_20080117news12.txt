Colombo, January 16, 2008: The United States strongly confemns today's vicious terrorist attack on a civilian bus in Uva Province that killed at least 24 persons, including many women and children, and injured more than 60 others. We express our condolences to the victims and their families.

While no group has claimed responsibility for the attack, it bears all the hallmarks of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The targeting of civilians serves to foster fear and cause further suffering among the Sri Lankan people. Only a political solution to the country's conflict offers a way out of the current cycle of escalating violence.
