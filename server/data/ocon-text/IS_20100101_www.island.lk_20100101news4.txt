Foreign Minister Rohitha Bogollagama yesterday said that there was absolutely no truth in press reports that the government planned to appoint former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra as its economic adviser.

The Minister told The Island that during a telephone conversation with his Thai counterpart Kasit Piromya, an assurance had been given that Sri Lanka would not do anything to jeopardise the excellent relations between the two countries. He said that baseless reports on Shinawatra's appointment could be aimed at causing a rift between the two countries.

A section of the press on Wednesday quoted former prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat as saying that Shinawatra would be appointed an advisor to the government of Sri Lanka.

Somchai, Thaksin's brother-in-law, said the government should not worry because Thaksin's role as adviser to Sri Lanka, as well as to Cambodia, would do no harm to Thailand.
