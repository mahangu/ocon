Addressing a meeting sponsored by the Matara Lakvanitha and Youth Organisation at the Matara UNP main office, popular teledrama actress Upeksha Swarnamali said that many artistes speak in support of Presidential candidate Mahinda Rajapaksa either due to pressure brought on them or to seek favours.

She said that she was quite sure that many of those artistes who appear to be supporting President Rajapaksa would vote for General Fonseka at the Presidential election.
