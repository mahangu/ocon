NewsUS follows Brits out of Kollupitiya 

 On the heels of the British High Commission shifting from Galle Road, Kollupitiya to a new building complex at Bauddhaloka Mawatha recently, the US embassy too is making arrangements to leave the adjoining compound in Colombo 03, and is now looking for a fresh location to put up a new embassy.



 The United States Embassy for Sri Lanka and Maldives will shift from their current location as a part of a global initiative of the United States Government to rebuild new embassies as a response to the global security situation. The embassy at Kollupitiya was built in the 1970s by a leading Sri Lankan contractor.



 "Ten years ago the State Department decided to reconstruct US Embassies around the world, and we have rebuilt over 60 embassies around the world so far. The US Embassy for Sri Lanka and Maldives is next in line for reconstruction," said Counsellor for Press and Cultural Affairs, Jeffrey J. Anderson. 



 He added that although there were no specific security risks for the US embassy in Sri Lanka, the State Department feels that global security situation must be taken into consideration. "We don't feel that there is a particular security threat in Sri Lanka, but we must accept that US embassies have been increasingly targeted around the world," he said. Currently, the embassy is looking for a plot of land to build the new embassy. 



 The embassy advertised for a suitable land for the new complex last Sunday.

 Meanwhile, Indian Counsellor for press and cultural affairs, Dinkar Asthana said that the Indian Embassy officials have no intention of moving its embassy situated close by at Galle Face.
