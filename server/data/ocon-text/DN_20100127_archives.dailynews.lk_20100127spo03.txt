Korea wary of China in Asian battle

South Korea will look to world champion figure skater Kim Yu-Na to win their first gold outside speed skating at the Winter Olympics and help fight off a growing Chinese threat.

South Korea were the best-performing Asian nation in Turin four years ago, taking home six golds, three silvers and two bronze - all from speed skating events, with all but one bronze in the short track.

Their haul meant they finished seventh in the medals charts - well clear of the next-best Asian nation, China, who took home just two golds.

Korean Olympic chiefs, sending their largest-ever squad of 26 men and 19 women, are eyeing at least another five golds in Vancouver - one in women's figure skating and four in skating.

Athletes will compete in skating, skiing, biathlon, bobsled and skeleton at the February 12-28 Games.

"We hope Yu-Na will bring the country's first gold outside of speed skating," said Korean Olympic Committee (KOC) spokesman Kim Tae-Hyung, admitting the country had struggled to compete in other sports.

Kim Yu-Na, dubbed the "Figure Queen" by South Korean media, has dominated her discipline for the past two seasons.

The 19-year-old is the hot favourite after dazzling the judges so far this season, notching the highest-ever women's total score of 210.03 points in winning the Trophee Eric Bompard in Paris in October.
