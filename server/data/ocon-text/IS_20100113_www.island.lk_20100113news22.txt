The Sri Lanka Navy rescued a critically-injured fisherman 100 kilometres off Mullaitivu Monday night (11) and rushed him ashore for immediate medical assistance in the early hours of yesterday.

The skipper of the Multi-day Fishing Trawler 'Palinga 01' had been critically injured whilst engaged in fishing 100 kilometres east of Mullaitivu. He was badly in need of medical assistance. The Navy was contacted by the Department of Fisheries for assistance and Navy's Offshore Patrol Vessel SLNS 'Sayura' was dispatched on the rescue mission. The crew members of 'Sayura' carried out a mid sea transfer of the patient and took him on board for emergency medical treatment. The patient was later transferred on to a smaller vessel by SLNS 'Sayura' upon entering Trincomalee Harbour and the patient was rushed to the Trincomalee General Hospital by Naval personnel for further medical treatment.

The Sri Lanka Navy performs a multi-faceted role being the first line of defence of the Island-nation. Fishery protection and providing assistance to fishermen in times of distress are among its numerous tasks and Naval ships and craft are dispatched on rescue and search operations in deep sea.
