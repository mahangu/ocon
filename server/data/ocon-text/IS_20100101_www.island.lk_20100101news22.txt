Chairman, Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) Rumi Marzook told 'The Island' that the CPA netted Rs 210 million during the last 11 months by way of fines imposed on traders who sold rice above the controlled price, after prosecuting them.

Marzook said over 3,000 traders who sold rice above the controlled price were prosecuted, during the November-December period.

"Already the government has ordered a consignments of rice from various countries to meet the demand and once they arrive the traders would not be able to sell rice at black market prices," Marzook said.
