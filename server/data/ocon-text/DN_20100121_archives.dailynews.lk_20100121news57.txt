MoU signed for first mega solar power project

The country's first ever large scale grid connected solar power project of 500kw power generating capacity will be set up at Buruthankanda in Hambantota district with Korean Government funds.

The MoU was signed yesterday between the Korean and the Sri Lanka Governments with the participation of Power and Energy Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne, KOICA residential representative Song Min-Hyeon, Power and Energy Ministry Secretary M.M.C. Fernando and Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority(SLSEA) Chairman Krishan Deheragoda.

The project will function as the pathfinder for solar based power generation projects in the country. Being the first of its kind, the project will provide knowledge required to operate a commercial scale solar power generation project. Further it allays any fear of the investors about the solar power PV technology and drive investment in this sector. The revenue generated from the project will be channeled to the rural electrification program of the SLSEA which has already identified 12 villages for immediate implementation.
