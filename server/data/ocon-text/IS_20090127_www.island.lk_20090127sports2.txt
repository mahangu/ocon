An impressive all-round performance from South Africa saw the visitors clinch a 3-1 series victory in Adelaide.

After restricting the hosts to just 222, the South Africans never looked troubled as the romped to an eight-wicket victory.

Herschelle Gibbs gave impetus to the Proteas innings with a brisk 38 at the top of the order, before Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers chipped in with unbeaten fifties to see the visitors home against a tame looking Aussie bowling attack.

The hosts were in a strong position at 110 for two, with captain Ponting (63) and Mike Hussey scoring at around a run-a-ball.

But the pair were dismissed in quick succession - and when Brad Haddin followed soon afterwards, Australia found themselves 130 for five at the 25-over mark.

James Hopes posted a responsible and well-paced 42 off 44 deliveries, and Cameron White made a fighting 30 but got out chasing a wide Dale Steyn delivery.

Wickets fell at regular intervals, Steyn finishing with three for 49. Makhaya Ntini took some early punishment from Ponting but fought back to finish with three for 52.

The Proteas made an early breakthrough by dismissing opener David Warner, caught by Morne Morkel off Ntini at mid-on in the second over.
