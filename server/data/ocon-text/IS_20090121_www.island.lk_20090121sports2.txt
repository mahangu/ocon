As Tier 'B' is about to play its semi-final round, Tier 'A' of this year's Premier One-day tournament, organised by Sri Lanka Cricket, is to continue today with five more matches to be played at five venues in Colombo.

The Tier 'A,' which began on November 9 last year with the participation of 11 teams, will be over in three more weeks. The next remaining rounds are set to be worked off on Jan. 28, Feb. 5 and 11.

Tier 'B' semi-finals delayed

Meanwhile, the semi-final stage of Tier 'B' is yet to be held, following the tournament's first round finish on Jan. 14. Due to a calculation mishap, as it was reported, the fourth Tier 'B' qualifier for the semi-finals is yet to be confirmed by the SLC and as a result, the three other semi-final entrants, Police SC, Seeduwa â€“ Raddoluwa CC and Sebastianites C&AC will have to wait till one from either Panadura SC or Lankan CC is picked by the organisers to join three present semi-finalists.
