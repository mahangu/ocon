Petroleum workers yesterday gave the government a two-week deadline to return the shares and 107 filling stations held by the Treasury to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation.

They threatened to strike after January 15 if the government did not do so, president of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation's General Employees' Union Nimal Ananda told a press conference yesterday.

The treasury was holding these shares and filling station from 2004, he said.

"The previous UNF government had planned to sell the CPC in three stages. In the first stage, a part of the CPC was sold to the Indian Oil Company in 2002. Another part of the corporation had been earmarked to be sold to the Bharat Petroleum in 2004 under the UPFA government. However, it was prevented by workers through the means of a strike. Then this earmarked part had been placed under the purview of the Treasury. The government had promised release it shortly but still the promise had not been implemented," Ananda said.

Minister of Petroleum and Petroleum Resources Development A. H. M. Fawzie said that the CPC is in the process to reclaiming these shares and filling stations. Of them 50 filling stations are already operating under the purview of the CPC. The Ministry is seeking Attorney General's advice for take back to other properties.

Ananda denied the Minister's statement and said if the CPC is operating 50 filling stations, they were owned by the treasury.
