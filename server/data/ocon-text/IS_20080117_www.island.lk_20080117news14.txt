Pilot project to to improve breeding stock of cattle increase number of fertile cows

Of the 1.1 million cattle population in Sri Lanka, only 5,000 cows are fit for breeding purposes. A pilot project is afoot to increase this number.

To increase the production of milk, this hurd has to be increased by five times, National Livestock Development Board Chairman, Dr. Chandrawansa Pathiraja said yesterday.

Pathiraja told media personnel: "We hope to increase the amount by 25,000 fertile cows. To achieve this task, we decided to import embryos from Australia."

He said 200 embryos were brought to Sri Lanka recently, out of which 110 embryos were deposited to recipient cows locally and 21 calves were born.

University of Peradeniya Senior Lecturer in Veterinary Medicine, Dr. Basil Alexander said that they had experienced a 60 per cent success rate and estimates showed that nearly 70 percent of the calves to be females. However, there is also a demand for bulls.

He also said that the 200 embryos were mixed sex or unsexed embryos, as the cost is higher for female embryos.

Pathiraja added that in future they will order only female embryos.

He said that with these embryos, the three top varieties of cows will give more milk, between 25 and 35 liters per day in comparison to local cows that give only one to two liters.
