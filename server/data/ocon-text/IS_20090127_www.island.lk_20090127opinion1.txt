From a very simplistic point of view, language doesn't inhibit thinking or creativity. The thinking and creative mind doesn't constrain itself to already known words to express itself, it invents new words; for instance, if one wants to find the meaning of a word on google, one googles the word; now that's a new word. One can also say that the thinking and creative mind doesn't inhibit its expression by sticking to the context in which the meaning of a given word has been used in the past; for example, the word, virus prior to the use of computers meant, a micro-organism that is smaller than a bacterium and can cause disease in humans, animals, or plants (From the Free online dictionary)

Virus in computer language is used in an entirely different context.

Therefore, the thinking and creative mind extends the meaning of already known words to give expression to new concepts.

I guess nothing constrains thinking and creativity or frees the thinking and creative mind more, than thinking itself.
