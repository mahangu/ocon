Despite the lack of goals during normal play, the match was packed full of action with both teams playing fast, free-flowing football.

The win sets up an Old Firm final after Rangers defeated Falkirk in Tuesday's semi-final.

The game started at a frantic pace and Celtic had a chance with less than a minute gone.

Shunsuke Nakamura's cross from the left was pushed out by Lukasz Zaluska only as far as Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink but the striker's weak shot was cleared by Gary Kenneth. Then a minute later Flood, a target for Celtic in the transfer window, went on a mazy run past several defenders before he forced Boruc into a good save from a low shot. In the sixth minute, Nakamura made room for himself in the box and his cross-cum-shot had to be cleared off the line by Flood.
