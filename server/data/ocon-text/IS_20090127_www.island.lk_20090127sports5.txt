She next plays Olympic gold medalist Elena Dementieva, the No. 4 seed from Russia who made the quarter-finals for the first time in 11 years at Melbourne Park with a 6-2, 6-2 win over Slovakia's Dominika Cibulkova.

Azarenka was taking the match to Williams, with both women going for winners constantly.

Williams was looking quicker on her feet than in her last two matches, but her first serve was another matter.

Clearly trying to concentrate, she regularly was bouncing the ball 20 times - she once hit 37 - before making her toss.

At 3-5 in the first set, Williams double-faulted for the second time to give Azarenka a set point, then loudly cursed her first serve, earning a warning from the umpire for an audible obscenity and sending a backhand long on the next point.

Things got better for Williams as she saved three break points in her opening serve of the second set in a game that went to deuce five times, then broke Azarenka to pull ahead at 2-1, shouting "Come on!"

Azarenka appeared to become ill after pulling within 3-2 and went off court. Williams took advantage of the time to get her ankles retaped.

Serena Williams, who has won the Australian title in 2003, 2005 and 2007, and Kuznetsova are the only major winners still in the women's draw.
