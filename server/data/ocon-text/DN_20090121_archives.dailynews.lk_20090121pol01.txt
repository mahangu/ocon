Speaker to determine fate of UNP No- Confidence Motion

Speaker W.J.M. Lokubandara told Parliament yesterday that he would inform the House today whether the UNP sponsored No-Confidence Motion against the Government had lapsed or not.

This was sequel to a query raised by several UNP MPs as to why the UNP's No- Confidence Motion had not been included in yesterday's Order Paper.

The Speaker informed the House that he would inquire from the Secretary General of Parliament about the issue and will make a detail statement to the House today (January 21).

Chief Government Whip Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said that the UNP had asked two days to debate the Motion and the Government agreed to debate it within a day by allocating the total number of eight hours for the Debate.

They walked out of Parliament on Thursday protesting against the inclusion of the Debate in Friday's Order Paper, stating that they will not come to Parliament on Friday. However, they came to Parliament on Friday but did not move the No- Confidence Motion, the Minister said.
