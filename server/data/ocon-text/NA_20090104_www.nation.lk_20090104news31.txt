 G.C.E.A/L 2008 examination results were released yesterday, ending a prolonged delay of over a month for candidates.

 "The examination results of the Colombo and Sri Jayewardenepura educational zones were released yesterday and the results of the other educational zones will be posted today," said the Examinations Commissioner Anura Edirisinghe.



 He also said that the candidates who have obtained highest results in all four streams will be announced today. Kavin Weerasinghe of Royal College has received the highest results in the science stream. 



 The 2008 A/L examinations began on August 6 and the evaluation commenced on August 20. The marking process however, was disrupted as some of the teachers' unions boycotted evaluation sessions in order to protest against the Government's delay to rectify their salary anomalies that have existed for over a decade. Although the evaluation sessions were conducted, various complications arose due to the lack of teachers. A fundamental rights petition was filed by an A/L student in the Supreme Court, pointing out that the disruptions in the process of the A/L examination and the paper marking sessions have violated his fundamental rights. Thus the Supreme Court ordered that the evaluation sessions should be resumed immediately.



 As a result of all these incidents, this year, the release of the results of the A/L examinations was delayed. Usually, G.C.E.A/L examination results are released by the end of November for the convenience of the students, who wish to apply for universities abroad.
