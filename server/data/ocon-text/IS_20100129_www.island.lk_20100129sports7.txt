Sri Lanka's wrestlers will leave the country on February 4 to contest the 11th South Asian Games which gets underway today, in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

The team comprises five players and is spearheaded by Kelum Fernando of the Navy. Fernando will compete in the 120 kg class.

S. D. Kumara of the Sri Lanka Navy (60kg class), R. I. Liyanage of the Sri Lanka Air Force (66kg class), E. M. L. Priyankara of the Sri Lanka Navy (84kg class), and M. S. C. Perera of the Sri Lanka Navy (94 kg class) are the other players who will participate at the South Asian Games. The team will be accompanied by S. M. Abeysekara (coach), K. J. Piyaratne (Assistant coach) and J. S. W. Samarakoon (Team Manager).

All eight countries participating at the games will field teams for the wrestling bouts. The bouts will be worked off from February 6 to 8 at the Kabaddi Stadium, Paltan.

At the last Games held in 2006 in Colombo, Sri Lanka won one silver and three bronze medals in the wrestling events. Hot favourites India did not participate in the wrestling events.

The Sri Lankan team is already in India on a practice tour. They will be back on January 31 and will leave for Bangladesh on February 4.

The team's coach S. M. Abeysekara expressing his views on the medals prospects at this year's Games said, "We are confident that we can win two silver and three bronze medals. I expect silvers from the 60kg and 66kg classes. I took over as coach only a few months ago and we had time only to practice in the mornings. But I am confident our team can win five medals," he said.
