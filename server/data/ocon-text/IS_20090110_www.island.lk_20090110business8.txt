The CNCI notes with sadness and regret, the unprovoked attack and destruction of equipment and property belonging to the Sirasa & MTV media complex in Depanama, Pannipitiya, during the early hours of January 5th. The Chamber unequivocally condemns this cowardly attack by a group of armed persons.It is well known that Sirasa & the MTV network provide a multiplicity of services and a wealth of information to the people of this country. Apart from the presentation of up to the minute news items on a diversified variety of topics, Sirasa/MTV also provides educational and informative programmes to the general public. Therefore this type of incidents should not be permitted to spread, which could culminate in lawlessness and in a national calamity. Aggressions such as these have remained unchecked far too long and now it is time to put a halt to these by taking stern action.

We applaud, The President and other leaders for condemning this attack, and for the action being taken to bring the culprits to book.

Once again the CEYLON NATIONAL CHAMBER of INDUSTRIES as the premier Industrial Chamber in the country reiterates its support and co-operation to all at the Sirasa & MTV media complex at this time.
