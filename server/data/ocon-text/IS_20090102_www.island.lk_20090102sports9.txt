The Island-SportsHarbhajan Singh, never short of a word when it comes to Australia, has some 'advice' for the world champions: stop talking and concentrate on the basics, cricket365.com reported on its web site.

Australia suffered their first Test series defeat at home in 16 years after South Africa took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the Test series with a nine-wicket victory in Melbourne on Tuesday.

The Australians are also coming off 2-0 series loss away to India. Harbhajan feels the Aussies are talking a bit too much.

"I think they concentrate a lot on talking when other teams concentrate on the game and getting the basics right," the spinner was quoted as having told India's Times Now.

Harbhajan says that it's "nice" to see Australia at the receiving end after dominating cricket for more than a decade.

"I always believed any team can beat Australia," he added. "It's not that they are superior to other teams or that they are world powers.

"Other teams are getting better and it's nice to see people dominating them," Harbhajan was further quoted as having said.
