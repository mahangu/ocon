NewsThe Maldivian Government yesterday urged Sri Lankan small and medium scale entrepreneurs to form strategic business partnerships in the Maldives. This is a part of the Maldivian government's plan to privatise many of the state owned institutions in that country.



 "In the past years the Maldivian Government has accumulated a lot of state run institutions, and the present Maldivian Government believes that the time has come to privatise these institutions," said President of Maldives, Mohamed Nasheed speaking at an event in Colombo yesterday. "We always had close relations with Sri Lanka and we would like if the Sri Lankan entrepreneurs joined hands with the Maldivian Government in its venture to form partnerships with the private sector," he added. 

 Addressing a gathering of small and medium entrepreneurs the Maldivian President said that Indian and European investors had already expressed their willingness to invest in Maldives. Sri Lankans have been heavily investing in the Maldives in the recent past and the Maldivian Government was willing to help them in all possible ways. 



 "We have not forgotten how the Sri Lankans helped us in our struggle for a more democratic Maldives," he said.

 The Maldivian President accompanied by a high level delegation including 11 Ministers and state Ministers who arrived at the request of President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, will leave Sri Lanka today. (RK)
