The Board of Investment is said to have purchased 4 floors at the World Trade Centre, at a cost of Rs.1,500 million, a few months ago despite it having purchased the Cashew Corporation building at Kollupitiya for Rs.276 million to house its office, informed sources said. The present BOI Chairman/Director General is planning to lease the Cashew Corporation building to open a hotel, the sources said.

The Cashew Corporation building purchased by the BOI was in a dilapidated condition and the BOI management decided to renovate it and house the BOI head office there. The BOI does not have a building of its own anywhere in the country. Although it had acquired the Cashew Corporation building, no action has so far been taken to renovate it.

BOI Chairman/Director General Dammika Perera told The Island that the 4 floors were purchased for a sum of Rs.550 million and not Rs.1,500 million. The unused Rs.600 million to the credit of the BOI was being spent on government development activities earning dividends.

Perera clarified that the BOI would not renew the present contract at the World Trade Centre and instead would purchase the floors it occupies. The Cashew Corporation building would be refurbished with a loan from the Bank of Ceylon. The BOI had decided to utilize the building for another profitable joint venture with the Bank of Ceylon.
