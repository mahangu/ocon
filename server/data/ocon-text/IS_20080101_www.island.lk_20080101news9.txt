"The New Year dawns amidst laments and sadness brought about by the war and its uncertainties and absence of success while the country is burdened with debt," UNP and Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said in his New Year message.

"The mental peace and freedom that accompanies the New Year the expectation of fulfilling targets, social gains and social security are not even seen in the distance. Instead harassment, social injustice and lack of expectation are overwhelmingly present.

"It is therefore necessary to become free of these unfortunate circumstances and for all sections of the people to build trust in one another and stand up on their feet with dedication to build a new and prosperous nation with a firm determination, the message stated.

"I hope our motherland and its people will be able to achieve these objectives in the New Year," he said.
