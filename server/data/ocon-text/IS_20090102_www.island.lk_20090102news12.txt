The Island-NewsThe Ceylon Electricity Board will lose all powers in handling the 900MW Norachcholai Coal Powered Plant as there were shabby deals to give full powers to the Lanka Coal Company, warned senior CEB officials.

No body else should be given powers to manage the electricity supply other than the CEB because one should not forget that national security comes first and it is of paramount necessity, they added.

Senior CEB sources told The Island yesterday that Power and Energy Ministry had given instructions that Lanka Coal Company would gradually take over the operation and maintenance of the Norachcholai Coal Power Plant.

According to Power and Energy Ministry sources the loan obtained to construct the Norachcholai Plant from the China Exim Bank could be repaid through power generation without being a burden to the Government.

However, senior CEB officials are not in favour with this decision as they believe it would make the CEB powerless when it comes to taking important decisions.

According to Power and Energy Ministry sources the Lanka Coal Company, which is a fully Government owned company under the administration of the Ministry.

Lanka Coal Company commenced operation recently and is in the process of selecting suppliers of coal to cater to the requirements of the first 300MW coal power plant to be commissioned at the end of 2010.
