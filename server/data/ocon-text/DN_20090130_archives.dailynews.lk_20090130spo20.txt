Vladimir Klitschko to fight Haye

Vladimir Klitschko will lay his IBF, WBO and IBO heavyweight titles on the line against British challenger David Haye for the WBC crown on June 20 at Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground, German daily Bild reported on Wednesday.

The "Hayemaker", 28, and the former cruiserweight champion, will fight Vladimir Klitschko after the Ukrainian and elder brother Vitali said they tossed a coin for which of the pair should meet the Briton.

"For the first time there was a little set-to between us brothers," said Vitali. "Our manager Bernd Boente came in and wanted to settle things. He found a solution - tossing a coin in the air and Vladimir won." Haye had last month intimated he would in fact face Vitali, back in the ring after four years away and who took the WBC crown in beating Nigerian Samuel Peter on a technical knockout on October 11.

Vladimir, 32 and nicknamed Dr. Steel Hammer, is believed to be the top heavyweight boxer still in action and can boast 52 wins in 55 bouts, his last success as recent as December 13 when the referee stopped American Hasim Rahman's punishment in the seventh.
