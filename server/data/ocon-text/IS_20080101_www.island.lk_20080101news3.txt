CHENNAI: AIADMK supremo J Jayalalithaa on Sunday said the LTTE was looking at Tamil Nadu as a future base as their strength was getting weakened in Sri Lanka.

"As all party leaders in Tamil Nadu, except me, are ready to welcome the LTTE with a red carpet, the atmosphere is conducive for the banned outfit to shift its base to the state," Jaya told journalists at the party headquarters.

With law and order being pathetic because of a "weak" (DMK) Government, this is an alarming and disturbing development, she cautioned.

The stand taken by the State and Central Governments regarding the Tigers is different from what is happening in reality, she charged further.

On the one hand the government warns of strong action against people supporting the LTTE but on the other, pro-LTTE rallies are permitted.

Supply of materials and commodities to the Tigers continues as well, she said.

Commenting on the statement of the National Security Advisor that the LTTE was not trying to infiltrate into India, Jayalalithaa said: "This is a sad state of affairs. People in responsible positions in the government are trying to deceive people. They show scant regard to maintaining law and order."

Stating that the AIADMK government had banned Maoists, Jayalalithaa said that re-emergence of naxalites in the southern districts showed the shoddy handling of the law and order mechanism.

Criticising Chief Minister M Karunanidhi for issuing a statement that he would continue to distribute free Colour TV sets, Jayalalithaa said, "He is behaving like emperor Nero who played his fiddle when Rome was burning."

It is irresponsible for a Chief Minister to concentrate on the free CTV scheme when people are in need of flood relief, she charged. (Indian Express)
