Amendments, approved recently by the Legal Draftsman, to the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance (FFPO) are to be presented for Cabinet approval shortly.

However, the Whildlife and Nature Protection Society states that if these amendments were included it would have a negative impact on the survival of some fauna and flora species.

The Society (WNPS) will shortly seek the intervention of its Patron President Mahinda Rajapaksa with regard to the set of amendments to the FFPO which it claims, will also have a serious impact on the environment.

A senior spokesman of the Society told The Island yesterday that they will also take up the matter with Environment and Natural Resources Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka and spell out the consequences.

He said with the amendments, there are many provisions proposed to be deleted from the original FFPO. These provisions include marine reserves, buffer zone and the protection of wild buffalos.

"Even the preamble to the Act to prevent the commercial exploitation of wildlife is to be deleted and substituted with 'prevention of commercial and other misuse of such fauna and flora' thus, down grading the protection given hitherto"

Another spokesman of the Society said a proposal of Managed Elephant Reserves (MER) has been included without giving a clear definition of what they are and how they are to be managed.

The Island learns another un-salutary feature in the amendment is the description given to National Reserves.

Wherever National Reserves have been specially mentioned such as Strict Natural Reserves (SNR) National Parks (NPP) Nature Reserves, Jungle Corridor, Refuge, Marine Reserve, Buffer Zone in the Original Act, they are being deleted and the term National Reserves substituted.
