Congratulations for your most outstanding, superb and forthright editorial on Christmas eve 2008! Your bold and candid statement titled, 'Of those quarrelling three arms', gives the gist (in brief) of all that happened in this so-called Paradise Isle since the early 1970s to date, politically and socially. The end result has been that government after government has taken the country and its people for a right royal ride. All governments have made the masses 'gonala anduwa'.

Needless to write pages and pages - but this single editorial reveals it all in the most simple and palatable manner. If our politicians of all parties as well as present rulers are honest they can take a leaf out of this editorial. We Sri Lankans will be very fortunate. But with my long experience I have my gravest doubt if they will ever dare.

Anyway it is left in the hands of the masses, the electorate at large, to take what is explained in this editorial into their heads and act right, come the next provincial or general or presidential election. Instead if they still keep on licking the dirty boots of politicians of all camps for their personal benefit, gain and satisfaction, well, the country and the nation will be the bad loser at the end of the day.

Over to you the general electorate - specially citizen Perera and citizen Silva.
