Ratnapura â€“ The Public Sector in Sri Lanka has an officer for every 18 persons to attend to their needs. In contrast, in India, 80 people are served by one officer, while in the USA, one public officer has to cater to 240 persons. Sri Lanka is the only country in the world with more government servants catering to the needs of the people.

Public Administration and Home Affairs Minister Karu Jayasuriya made this disclosure when he declared open a three storeyed building for the Divisional Secretary's office at Kegalle at a cost of Rs. 20 million.

The Divisional office has functioned for the last twenty years in rented buildings having shifted to four places during the period. Even though land was found, it had taken 12 years to commence work and this too due to pressure from the Chief Minister of Sabaragamuwa, Maheepala Herath, Minister Athauda Seneviratna and President's Advisor Prof. Jagath Balasuriya.

Minister Jayasuriya said the public service system in Sri Lanka was being widely criticized for its inactivity. He would see that this system became more active and people friendly. After the take over of the Public Administration Ministry and with the support of the President, he has revamped the Public Service system by holding a special 'people's day' to attend to their needs.

Today, the Minister said, any retired government servant from anywhere in the world can find solutions to his problems through modern technology systems. While in the past it took a person 48 months to obtain his land title deed, today it could be done within 4 days.
