Opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday advised all UNP MP's under threat to take legal action against the government for having reduced their security.

Addressing UNP MP's at the parliamentary complex,he said that the provision of state security was being used as a tool to prevent opposition MP's from speaking about the deteriorating human rights situation in the country,UNP sources said.

The government reduced the late Mr.Maheswaran's security knowing fully well that there was a threat to his life,Wickremesinghe said"So the best course of action for all MP's would be to seek legal action against the government for not providing security that they are entitled to,depending on the threat level."

Commenting on the abrogation of the Ceasefire Agreement,he said that the government will very soon realise the folly of its short sighted policies. "Unfortunately it is the people who would have to bear the consequences."

Wickremesinghe,recently told journalists that all opposition MP's including him,were finding it difficult to obtain proper state security for their protection.

"Even, I am having problems but I will come to that later.The government is duty bound to provide MP's under threat with sufficient security.Let us not hear excuses such as we told him to be careful after the person is dead."
