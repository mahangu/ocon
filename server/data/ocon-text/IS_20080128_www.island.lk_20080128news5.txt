JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Former dictator Suharto, an army general who crushed Indonesia's communist movement and pushed aside the country's founding father to usher in 32 years of tough rule that saw up to a million political opponents killed, died Sunday. He was 86.

"He has died," Dr Christian Johannes told The Associated Press, adding that he died at 1.10 p.m.
