People should make a decision for the country's good - Fonseka

The NDF Presidential candidate Sarath Fonseka said he will break the 1977 election victory record of former UNP leader J.R. Jayewardene addressing a recent public rally.

"When I see the very large crowds that are rallying round me I am convinced that I could break the 1977 landslide UNP election victory record of President J.R. Jayewardene," Fonseka said.

Addressing an election rally in Diyatalawa he said only honest politicians who want a change in the country were assisting him. "Although I have not signed agreements with any political party these parties were co-operating with me on the basis of trust. It was on that trust that I seek to bring in development to the country that the people were expecting."

"It is my policy to uplift the country that was coming down like a crashing aircraft. A new pilot and a new engine was needed to salvage the crashing aircraft that is our country. The aircraft with the new engine and new pilot had to be flown and I need the cooperation of the public to fly the renovated aircraft," he also said.

Continuing he said the public were intelligent and they cannot be swayed by promises. People not only love the present generation but also the next. They should not be deceived by the false promises made by politicians. They should make a decision for the good of the country on January 26.
