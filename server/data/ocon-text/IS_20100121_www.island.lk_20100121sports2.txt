Ceylonese Rugby & Football Club (CR&FC) has made plans to send two of its rugby players on rugby scholarships to South Africa, the club's Director Sports Dilroy Fernando said.

According to Fernando the two players who have been picked by the club to receive the special training in South Africa are Dhanushka Perera (Gertha) and Reza Mubarak.

"The players will receive training at a rugby academy. They'll receive special training on game planning and fitness and will be in South Africa for eight weeks," said Fernando who added that Perera and Mubarak would be available to wear the red jersey for CR&FC during the 2010 rugby season.

Fernando said that CR&FC was able to send the two players abroad for training thanks to Darbie Syman and Norman Larker who are employed by the rugby academy in South Africa.

Perera and Mubarak have had the experience of representing Sri Lanka at rugby.

Perera is an old Joe while Mubarak had his education at Isipathana College, Colombo.
