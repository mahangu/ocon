03 Jan 2010 RAMANATHAPURAM: Sri Lankan fishermen who are in detention here and whose release has been ordered by the government are dependent on a voluntary organisation for their food and other needs as no funds had been allotted by the government for their maintenance.

These Lankan fishermen were arrested by the Indian Coast Guard and the Indian Navy for trespassing the International Maritime Boundary Line. But they are not lodged in prison here or provided facilities, contrary to the procedure adopted by Sri Lanka in the case of Indian fishermen arrested by Sri Lankan navy for entering their territorial waters.

But here, the detained Lankan fishermen are kept at Marine police station or lodges. Two fishermen, Albert Rajmon and Mariyan Piradip of Pechalai, were detained on November 11, 2009, by the Indian Navy for entering Indian waters near Rameswaram.

The ICG detained five Lankan fishermen, Jude Merlil Santha, Sampath Kumara, Isro Sampath, Sunat Salimtha and Sumith Rosanta of Thoduva, near Puthalam district, while they were fishing in the Gulf of Mannar on November 24. The seven fishermen are under custody at Mandapam marine police station.

They are being provided food and other facilities by police personnel and Alliance for the Release of Innocent Fishermen (ARIF) on humanitarian grounds.

The Indian government had ordered the repatriation of the eleven fishermen to Sri Lanka. However, they are spending their days in police custody here, awaiting repatriation.

District Collector T N Hariharan told Express that the weather condition was not conducive for handing over the fishermen to Lankan navy personnel at mid sea. The ICG was also awaiting a communication from Sri Lanka that it was prepared to accept its fishermen.
