Angu Rajendran

The International Schools swimming championships which is a SLAASU(Sri Lanka Aquatic Association Union) sanctioned meet will be the start to the SLAASU swimming season this year. The meet which is organized by the Asian International School for the 22 International schools annually, will be held on February 18 and 19 at the Ananda College swimming complex. The meet which is usually held at the Sugathadasa stadium and houses more than 1200 swimmers and their parents and teachers over the two days had to be moved to a smaller venue as the stadium pool is under repairs and it is not known when it will be available for swimming.

The meet has been broken up into four sessions with the juniors swimming in the morning sessions and the seniors in the afternoon sessions so that all swimmers and parents may be accommodated.

The Ananda College pool authorities are doing their utmost to house the swimmers comfortably for the two days of the meet. Resika Udugampola of Gateway College and Mineka Karunaratne of Asian International School will be arriving straight from the SAF Games to swim at the meet.

Some of the other swimmers of repute that will be taking part in the senior age group will be Razeen Mujahireen (Lyceum), Chamaka Sinhabahu (Gateway), Isaac Prins (British School), Madhavi and Namindu Dharmadasa(Asian International) and Devinka Gunathilake (AIS).

A notable absentee this year will be Miniruwani Samarakoon (Gateway, Kandy) who holds records in almost all age groups.
