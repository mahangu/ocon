Rugby begins for the New YearRugby begins for the New Year The Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Association's (SLSRA) Annual General Meeting will be held at the Isipatana College Auditorium on Wednesday at 10am.



 Current President Dr. K. A. D. Punyadasa Principal of Isipatana College will serve out his second year uncontested as well Vice President J. Anurajeewa of Lumbini College. Kumar Rodrigo of Ananda College, Denzil Darling of S. Thomas's Bandarawela and W. Wijewardena of Vidyartha are the main contenders for the posts of Secretary and Treasurer respectively. SLSRA officials told The Sunday Times that unlike in previous years the AGM is unlikely to be chaotic as all the schools have been spoken to.



 Meanwhile The Referees Society will hold a felicitation ceremony today at Longden Place this morning. The event begins at 11am and all the past presidents of the association will be felicitated and given tokens of appreciation. Dilroy Fernando and Nizam Jamaldeen who have been appointed as assistant referees for the Rugby Sevens World Cup to be held in Dubai in March this year, will also be honoured today.



 Meanwhile Fernando was also felicitated earlier this week by the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union for his years of service as Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Fernando opted out of an extension after his contract expired.



 More importantly for Sri Lankan Rugby fans, the national team has been invited for the Hong Kong Sevens that will be held in the last weekend of March in Hong Kong. Sources said a squad will be picked and go in to training in the near future. 



 On a more somber note Kandy's number 8 Imran Bisthamin still remains in a critical condition with the initial prognosis being that even if he lives he may never walk again.
