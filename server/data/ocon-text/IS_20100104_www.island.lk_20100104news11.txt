The Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) wants Polls Chief Dayananda Dissanayake to appoint a Competent Authority to oversee the State-run media immediately. According to a CMEV statement issued on Saturday (January 2), the Commissioner had identified a person to monitor media bias though immediate action was necessary to appoint a Competent Authority. The CMEV said that the Commissioner should exercise powers vested in him by the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. The CMEV said,"We are of the firm belief that the fullest use of these powers is the best available means for the protection of the integrity of the electoral process and urges the Commissioner to act accordingly. The public enumeration of these powers alone is no substitute for the effective exercise and implementation of them in this election in which issues of constitutionality, respect for the Rule of Law and democratic governance are being especialty highlighted as being, under challenge. In this context we welcome the action taken by the Commissioners in halting the transfer of Superintendent of Police J. R. Jayawardane to Kilinochchi from Ampara, a course of action strongly urged by CMEV in communication with the Commissioner."

"CMEV notes with concern the upward trend in election related violence and calls upon all concerned especially the Election Commissioner and his officials, the Police and political parties to take all necessary steps to deter such violence and to deal with those who are responsible for it. We call on all presidential candidates to reiterate their commitment to eradicate political violence and malpractice in word and in deed. CMEV's experience with multiple elections confirms that the areas of violence on Election Day tend to coincide with the areas which experienced election related violence during the campaign."
