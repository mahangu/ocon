The government was abusing state resources and also allegedly assaulting opposition candidates contesting the forthcoming Central and North Western Provincial Council Elections, the UNP charged yesterday.

The party's Puttalam District MP, Palitha Ranga Bandara, addressing a news conference in Colombo, said that government backed UPFA candidates were using public officials and property including vehicles for their campaigns. "Duty conscious policemen who inquired into ten serious complaints made against UPFA candidates, were threatened by some Ministers and government MP's not to take any action. They even grabbed the policemen's weapons."

Citing an example of state resources being abused, he said that a UPFA candidate in Puttalam was using a Fisheries Ministry vehicle without a number plate for his campaign and was a law unto himself, but there is no one to stop him from violating election laws.

Bandara said that lawlessness was rampant and the government had allegedly set loose armed groups to assault and kill those who expose corruption and abuse of power." A fear psychosis has gripped the country and people are scared to speak the truth, lest they be gunned down or clubbed to death in broad daylight."

The only way to stop the rot that has set in, is to force the government to establish all the independent commissions in terms of the 17th Amendment to the constitution. The UNP for its part will continue to agitate, until such time the fundamental rights of the people are restored, Bandara added.
