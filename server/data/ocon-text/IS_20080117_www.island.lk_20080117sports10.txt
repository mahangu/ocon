Fernando Alonso topped the formula one test times at Jerez yesterday on his return to the Renault team with whom he won the 2005 and 2006 world championships, and vowed he would not change his approach and focus despite his troubled 2007 season with McLaren.

"It will be the same as I have always had," said Alonso, left. "At the start of any season the only thing I want to do is to work hard and to give maximum effort to achieve my potential. I know I can do this successfully with Renault because we have managed it in the past."

The Spaniard added that many things had changed at Renault since he left in 2006, "so in one sense it is a new adventure".
