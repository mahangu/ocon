The head of the election observation mission also said that 41 observers from 13 countries had been fielded in 22 districts to monitor the whole process since their arrival in the country on January 20.

He said the observers, representing the Association of Asian Elections Authorities, did not witness any significant deviation from the procedure as mentioned in election laws by the Returning Officers, while making preparations for the conduct of a free and fair election.

Dr. Pan also said the Elections Commissioner had issued necessary instructions to all Returning Officers to provide requisite security to the observers and facilitate them in the observation of the whole electoral process covering pre-poll arrangements by the Returning Officers, polling and counting of votes.

The commissioner took personal interest in making that short-term observation mission possible, the delegation leader added.

He also pointed out that the polling agents of candidates had been allowed to accompany the ballot boxes from polling stations to counting centres and no mentionable irregularities were reported in that regard.

The counting process started at all places after receipt of all the ballot boxes that were assigned to a counting centre, according to the observers.

On polls day, all relevant materials including the ballot boxes and cubicles had been made available in the polling stations and all procedural formalities completed by the SPOs before commencing the actual poll, added the mission chief.

He added: "I may mention that the election was held under the Presidential Elections Act no 15 of 1981 and the observers were able to see the whole process in the light of the provisions of that law. They did that and have reported that from the initial arrangements for the election till the conclusion of the counting process, the whole exercise was done in accordance with the law of the land."
