"We are extremely hopeful that terrorism will be totally eradicated soon so the business community will have an opportunity to expand business in the north and east to make the country's economy steady and flourishing", Chairman of the ASB Group of Companies Jayasiri de Silva said at the opening of the new ASB super market and 'Hotel Dulyana' at Anuradhapura.

The new seven storeyed building housing the ASB super market and the hotel is the tallest building complex in Anuradhapura.

De Silva said that as a tribute to the members of the Armed Forces. Police and the civil security corps they would be granted a 10 per cent discount on every item purchased from any of the 10 ASB super markets in the country from January 29.

This facility of 10% discount would be extended to the Samurdhi recipients, too in future.

We execute our business safely and all of us live without fear, owing to the heroic and gallant endeavours of the warheroes.

It is not enough just showing or exhibiting a banner or a cutout to honour such brave men and women. I hope the members of the country's business community would follow our way of saluting and admiring the warheroes" de Silva stressed.
