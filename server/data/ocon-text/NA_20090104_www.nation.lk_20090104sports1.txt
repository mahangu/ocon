SportsCHITTAGONG, Bangladesh, Jan 3, 2009 (AFP) - Tillakaratne Dilshan smashed a superb 162 off 165 balls to lead Sri Lanka's fightback on the opening day of the second and final Test against Bangladesh here on Saturday.



 Dilshan hit two sixes and 21 fours for his sixth Test century as the visitors recovered from a shaky 75-4 to reach a healthy 371-6 in their first innings at stumps after electing to bat.



 The middle-order batsman added 119 for the fifth wicket with opener Malinda Warnapura (63) and 173 for the next with Chamara Kapugedera (93 not out) to put Sri Lanka on course for a big total.



 Bangladesh's bowlers tasted early successes, with paceman Mashrafe Mortaza (2-48) picking two wickets in his opening two overs and spinner Shakib Al Hasan getting rid of skipper Mahela Jayawardene (11), playing his 100th Test.



 But Dilshan's aggressive knock, backed by valuable support from Warnapura and Kapugedera, helped the visitors seize back the initiative.

 Warnapura hit six fours in his 151-ball knock before being trapped leg-before by part-time spinner Mohammad Ashraful.



 Kapugedera looked set for his maiden Test century, having already hit 12 fours and a six from 117 balls.



 But it was Dilshan who punished the error-prone home bowlers the most, lofting paceman Shahadat Hossain for a six and then three fours in an over.

 Sri Lanka's batting flourished in the last two sessions as they added 306 in 63 overs for the loss of just three wickets.



 Dilshan, dropped on 82 off Mehrab Hossain, was finally dismissed by left-arm spinner Enamul Haque when he was bowled while trying a shot through the mid-wicket.



 Haque replaced paceman Mahbubul Alam for the only change in the Bangladesh side.

 Sri Lanka lead the series 1-0 after winning the opening Test in Dhaka by 107 runs. 

 St. Peter's cricketers who are in prime form managed to inflict their fourth outright defeat of the season with a ten-wicket win against St. Benedict's at Bambalapitiya yesterday. Under 19 Sri Lankan player Angelo Perera's all-round performance was the difference between the two sides. He managed a well compiled 58 in the first innings and followed it up with match figures of 9/100 with his off-breaks. 



 In reply to the Peterite first innings score of 253, Bens continuing from their overnight total of 128-7 lost their last three wickets for just one run. Following on they were shot out for 137 leaving the Peterites with the formality of scoring 13 runs for victory which they achieved in one over.

Sebs holds Joes to a draw

 A patient knock of 87 by Oshada Fernando and the 69-run last wicket partnership between Ranitha de Mel and Malan Fernando averted all hopes of St. Joseph's gaining an outright win in their 1st XI cricket match against St. Sebastian's played at Moratuwa yesterday. The Josephians recorded a mammoth 336 in their first essay and the Moratuwa school continuing from their overnight score of 59-1 went on to make a gutsy 308. Joes were 78-1 at the close of play.

Nalanda force a draw

Nalanda batsmen held their nerve to draw their 1st XI cricket fixture against S. Thomas', at Mt Lavinia yesterday. After the Thomians had declared at 271-9 on the first day, the Nalandians were struggling at 36-4 at the end of the first day. It was their all-rounder Dinuk Jayasinghe who added some solidity to their total with a hard hit 86 runs that included 13 fours. But Nalandians failed to avoid the follow on and were 99-5 in their second easy at stumps.

Replying to the Wesley first innings of 179, the Trinitians reached 256 with a fine contribution of 110 (11 fours, 3 sixes) from Dilan Gangoda. In their second innings the Wesley batting lineup fell to spin duo A. Jaleel and Akila Jayasundara who shared all ten wickets.

Continuing from their first innings score the home team scored 239 in reply to Royal's first innings of 301-8 declared. Adeel Riyal was the hero for the Anthonians scoring 91 runs with 16 fours. In their second innings Royal opener Banuka Rajapaksa continued his good form by scoring his second fifty of the match. Rajapaksa who made 81 in the first innings hit two sixes and seven fours in compiling 75.

Dull draw

 Even exchanges saw the match played between Maris Stella and Kalutara Vidyalaya end in a dull draw at Negombo yesterday. Maristonian pacey Vikum Dassanayake stole the limelight with figures of 6/43 in the second innings. 

 Maris Stella 147 (64) and 171-6 dec (46) (Ashen Silva 47, Dasun Shanaka 33, Malinda Samarasekara 30, Devaka Kurera 23, Savith Priyan 2/39)

 The vice-captain was unbeaten on 73, his maiden half-century at the SCG in his fifth Sydney Test, as Australia scrapped their way to 6-267 at stumps on Saturday.



 Trailing 2-0 in the three-match series, Australia had slumped to 5-162 after tea before New South Wales teammates Clarke and Brad Haddin began the rescue mission on their home ground.

 They added 75 before man-of-the-series contender Dale Steyn (2-71) struck in his first over with the second new ball. Steyn bowled wicketkeeper Haddin for 38 with a stunning outswinger.



 Clarke's 73 came in five minutes short of four hours and included nine fours. No.8 batsman Mitchell Johnson was 17 not out.

 Opener Simon Katich, who made 47, said honours were even on day one. However the NSW captain said he expected the SCG pitch to deteriorate as the game wears on as Australia's two left-arm quicks Doug Bollinger and Mitchell Johnson dig up the footmarks for off-spinner Nathan Hauritz in the fourth innings.

 "You can tell he (Clarke) is keen for a big one here. I think he mentioned before the game that he hadn't scored a hundred here and he's keen," Katich said.



 "The way he has played today was very, very good. Hopefully he can carry that on in the morning with Mitch. If we can get a few more partnerships in the morning and push on towards 350 then, runs on the board here are always vital.

 "There are some cracks already starting to open up even though it wasn't hot today. So it will be interesting if it does get hot in the next few days, they could open up and it generally does get lower and slower as the days go on here."



 Clarke was dropped on 12 and 69 and Johnson also had some luck with an edge through the vacant third slip on eight.

 "I think we are still probably just ahead. But at 249 for seven (Clarke was dropped at 6-249) it would have been a fantastic day," South Africa assistant coach Vinnie Barnes said.



 Matthew Hayden's career remained under threat, failing to rediscover his former glory with a patchy innings of 31 before dragging a full-length ball from Dale Steyn onto his stumps at 3-109. 

 The 37-year-old veteran of 103 Tests faced 78 balls and hit four boundaries but, despite the urging of the crowd, the Queenslander's timing was absent. Hayden has scored only 78 runs at 15.60 in the series and is yet to announce if he wants to play on for next month's tour of South Africa.



 Left-arm spinner Paul Harris removed Mike Hussey caught at slip for 30 in his first over at 4-130, bringing nervous debutant Andrew McDonald to the crease. McDonald had his helmet knocked off his head by a bouncer from Morne Morkel and looked out of his depth in his 64-minute stay. The red-headed Victorian eventually departed caught behind for 15 off Makhaya Ntini's bowling at 5-162.



 Australia won the toss in overcast conditions and lost two wickets before lunch. Katich hit 47 off 52 deliveries and captain Ricky Ponting made a first-ball duck.

 The Proteas can take the top ranking from Australia if they win the Test. 



Scores: Australia 267-6 (88) at close (M Hayden 31, S Katich 47, M Hussey 30, M Clarke 73 n.o., B Haddin 38, D Steyn 2/71) v South Africa 

 The Premier Tier 'B' match between Air Force and Seeduwa/Raddoluwa which began on Friday at Rifle Green, a few yards away from the location of the suspected LTTE suicide bomb blast later that evening, was abandoned yesterday after a few players from the visiting team had been adversely affected by the experience. 



 When an official of the hosting team Air Force was contacted by The Nation he said that around 4 players of Seeduwa/Raddoluwa CC were affected by the bomb blast. "When we gathered to resume the second day's play yesterday, some of the players from the Seeduwa/Raddoluwa team were not present. We were told that they had felt the shock of Friday's bomb blast and their families didn't want these players to continue the match at the present venue," the Air Force official said.



 However, an official of the Seeduwa/Raddoluwa CC told The Nation that they have officially written a letter to Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) requesting to reschedule the match to another date. "We informed the match referee that our players are not in a position to continue playing after the shock they had. At first he agreed but yesterday morning he changed his stance. So we decided to officially write a letter of appeal to the SLC to reschedule the match," said the Seeduwa/Raddoluwa official.



 He further stated that four of their players had been injured by the blast. "The match finished at the scheduled time on Friday. We were crossing the road not far away from where the incident occurred. Four of our players received injuries. One player was injured badly as debris from the bomb had directly hit him. The other three players had bled from their ears. No matter what the outcome may be, psychologically our players are not in good shape to continue playing. We hope SLC would reschedule the match," he added.



 The official further said as long as the match is rescheduled the venue would not be a matter for them. "It doesn't matter where we get to play on another day. But certainly not immediately after the shocking experience."

 Air Force 84-3 KARACHI: Pakistan's hastily-arranged home series against Sri Lanka has fallen into scheduling problems because of Indian cricket board's interference, according to media reports. 

 A report in the daily 'Jang' claimed that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has forced Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) to make tough demands regarding the tour. 

 The views seem to be based on media reports originating from Sri Lanka that India is not happy with Sri Lanka's cricket tour of Pakistan. 



 Arjuna Ranatunga, the head of the SLC interim committee which was later dismissed by the government, accepted Pakistan's invitation to fill in for India. But after the government cleared the tour, Indian authorities expressed their displeasure over the next month's series, the report said. 



 Ranatunga had agreed on a six-week tour, including three Tests and five One-dayers. Under that programme, Sri Lanka was supposed to arrive in Pakistan January 20 and stay till February 25. 

 But the current SLC officials want a reduced tour with just two Tests, three ODIs and a Twenty20 game. They want to send their team to Pakistan in mid-February. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is now in a fix as the schedule will clash with Pakistan's One-day series in Bangladesh which is slated to begin March 3. 



 The reports claim BCCI has been working in the background to ensure that Pakistan does not get good matches after India cancelled its tour of Pakistan because of Mumbai terror attacks. 

 BCCI enjoys considerable influence over regional cricket boards like SLC and Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and is using it to derail PCB plans to host a full series against Sri Lanka in a bid to compensate for the cancellation of their much-awaited home games against India, it said. 



 Some television channels have also aired reports that BCCI is pulling strings to jeopardize Sri Lanka's tour of Pakistan. 

 Both PCB and SLC are still working on the tour itinerary and are expected to finalize it within the next couple of days. – [IANS] Windies win with one ball to spare CHRISTCHURCH, (AFP) - The West Indies beat New Zealand by five wickets with one ball to spare in a rain shortened second one-day cricket international at AMI Stadium here Saturday.
