A Bill to establish a National Land Commission, has been approved by the Cabinet of Ministers, Media Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa, said yesterday.

The proposed bill, he said was submitted by Lands and Land Development Minister Jeevan Kumaranatunga. "The establishment of a National Land Commission has been under discussion for many years, but was never implemented. Now that the Cabinet has approved the proposed Bill, under the Mahinda Chintana programme, the legal process would take its course."

A proposal by President Mahinda Rajapaksa in his capacity as Finance Minister, to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with Australia, for implementation of a AU$ 5.7 million Basic Education Support Programme in Sri Lanka, was also approved by the cabinet of ministers, Yapa said.

"The funds would be channelled through the UNICEF, CPAP. The overall objective of the programme, is to improve the learning environment and will be implemented over a three and half year period. It would benefit children from schools in Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, Moneragala, Trincomalee, Batticaloa and Ampara."

Among the other proposals that received Cabinet approval, he said was a Memorandum by President Rajapaksa to exchange notes with the Japan International Cooperation Agency, to obtain 390 million Yen for development of the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital. This would include improvement of the curative healthcare service and to purchase medical equipment.
