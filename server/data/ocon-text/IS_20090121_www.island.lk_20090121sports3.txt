LONDON (AP) - England's cricket board confirmed Tuesday that businessman and lawmaker Jonathan Marland will challenge Giles Clarke in an election to be its next chairman.

Giles was hoping to be elected unopposed, but the England and Wales Cricket Board said it had received two nominations and would hold a ballot of the 18 first-class counties and the MCC.

Clarke, who has come under fire over the turmoil that led to the ECB firing coach Peter Moores and Kevin Pietersen quitting as captain, has been proposed by Nottinghamshire and seconded by Northamptonshire and Middlesex. Lancashire has put Marland's name forward with support from Hampshire and Leicestershire.

The ballot will close Feb. 9 and the winner will then have to be approved by all 41 ECB members with a result announced Feb. 25.

Marland announced his candidacy on Monday, saying that the image of the England team, in a year when it challenges Australia for the Ashes, had been hurt by Pietersen's fallout with Moores and also England's heavy loss in the winner-take-all $20 million Stanford Twenty20 games in Antigua in November.

"There are deep schisms within the game which need to be healed, and I believe I can be a unifying candidate," Marland said. "The image of our game has been very badly damaged during Giles Clarke's time at the helm and the Stanford and Moores-Pietersen affairs of recent months have highlighted both errors of judgment and management failures.

"An uncontested election would imply endorsement of these errors and failures, and that would be wrong."
