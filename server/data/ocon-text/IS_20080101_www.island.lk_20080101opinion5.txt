Government has been granting generously duty free vehicles for MPS and

Government employees and various categories every 5 years.

We urge the President to stop this corrupt system and allow vehicles every 10 years and not every 5 years.We are a poor country and cannot afford to allow luxury vehicles every 5 years.The massive number of MPs, seems to be continuing their spending free to import luxury vehicles and selling to third parties at a profit.We see this as a utter waste of foreign exchange sent home.

It is very much an open secret that many politicians and others sell their Duty free vehicles every 5 years and making millions to get another Duty Free Vehicle from the government.
