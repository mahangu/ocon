Further to the various media articles that have appeared with allegations against me I would like to categorically deny these baseless and irresponsible allegations. To date I have not been given any kind of a formal charge sheet by any person in authority.

As such I wish to state that I am very proud to have represented my country from the commencement of my cricketing career as a national player, national captain, team manager/ advisor and development manager at Sri Lanka Cricket and assumed my present duties as the Chief Executive of Sri Lanka Cricket in the year 2004.

I also wish to state that I have carried out my duties honestly and diligently and with the best interest of Sri Lanka Cricket, the players and the staff at Sri Lanka Cricket and the country at heart.
