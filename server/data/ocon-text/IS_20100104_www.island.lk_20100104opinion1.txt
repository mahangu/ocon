The Island editor's advice (Vote for the man who promises the least; he'll be the least disappointing quoting Bernard Baruch) comes not a day too late as the newspaper's Financial Review of 15th December quoted from an official report (2009) which says that the country's fiscal situation is precarious.

The report co-authored by the Central Bank, Department of Census and Statistics and the Ministry of Labour has said: "Overall, the country's fiscal situation remains precarious, with government budget deficits above 7 per cent each year since 1998 along with current account deficits".

Since the drain on the budget will depend more on the cost (rather than the number) of the promises made, will an economist or accountant help the voter by working out the cost of the different packages to enable him to pick the least damaging from the point of view of the economy, as he would be in a bigger mess than he is in today if the country's economy collapses!
