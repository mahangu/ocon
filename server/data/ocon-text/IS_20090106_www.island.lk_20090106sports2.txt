The Island-SportsIt seems Pietersen dislikes aspects of the way Mr Moores does his job. One problem is said to be the omission of Michael Vaughan, Pietersen's predecessor, from the side to tour West Indies next month. Former captains say that in this battle only Pietersen can win.

Why? Mr Moores seems to be more popular with and respected by the players than the brash, temperamental Pietersen. Pietersen's record on the tour of India, losing a one-day series 5-0 and the Tests 1-0, hardly puts him in the box seat.

With our cricket in this state its bigwigs should stop infighting and start working out how to beat the real enemy.
