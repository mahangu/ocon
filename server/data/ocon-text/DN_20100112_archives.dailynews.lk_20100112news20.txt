What the authors say

The authors of the publication "The impact of corruption on Poverty and Economic Growth" Prof. A D V de S. Indraratne, Lloyd F. Yapa, R.M.B. Senanayake and Lionel Perera in a statement to the Daily News say that some politicians and the election manifesto of Retired General Sarath Fonseka have quoted from their publication out of context. They further say:

The report refers to corruption in Sri Lanka at Central, Provincial and Local Government levels under "practically all the administrations" (Part 4, pp.18-23), particularly since the nineteen seventies (para 7 under Executive Summary) and not relating to one particular year.

In Appendix F(p.82), "we have hazarded" an estimate of the magnitude of corruption. 2006 was selected for this estimate of corruption as the authors had access to the finding of the COPE Report 2007 and 2006 was the latest year for which GDP data were available at the time of writing the report.
