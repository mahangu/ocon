Happy after peace - Chief Kurkkal

Cendric Kumaran Kovil Chief Kurkkal Dematagoda Needi Rasa Sharma of the Western Province United Tamil Organization (WPTUO) said that they were very happy today after peace was achieved under the leadership of President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Today no one was checking our kovils and we perform our religious rites in peace and freedom. We do not trust candidate Sarath Fonseka and will wholeheartedly support President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

A WPTUO member Champika Wijeratnam said we lived in fear and doubt earlier. But now we are a free people. Therefore we will work to make President Mahinda Rajapaksa our king.

President WPTUO Saroja Devi said they had worked for the UNP before but now they would work for President Mahinda Rajapaksa as Sarath Fonseka is trying to do a job that he had no qualifications to do.
