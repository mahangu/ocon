Govt committed to rural uplift

Chaminda Perera in Matugama

President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday said people in rural areas will receive all facilities which were confined only to the pampered class in Colombo. He said the Government was dedicated to uplift the living standards of the people in rural areas for the past four years while terrorism was being eradicated.

The President vowed to ensure better future for all communities in the ensuing years before thousands of people who flocked to Matugama UC grounds yesterday. This election rally was organized by Industrial Development Minister and Kaluatara District SLFP Leader Kumara Welgama.

The President stressed his victory at the forthcoming Presidential election will show the international community that the people have expressed solidarity with the Government led by him.

The President reiterated that part of the country was handed over to the terrorists in an agreement when he came to power in 2005. The United National Front Government led by Opposition Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe did not provide a single employment to the youth. The President stressed the plans were under way to reduce the workforce in the public sector from 0.6 to 0.3 million.

He said the Government was able to increase the number of Government servants from 0.6 million to 1.2 million during the past four years and the public servants should provide better service to the people.

"We will implement massive housing schemes for public servants soon and several welfare programs are also in the offing," he said.

It is not my tradition to give promises which cannot be realized. He stressed the Government does not give any promises that cannot be fulfilled.

The country received tremendous infrastructure development during the past four years and the Government remains dedicated to further develop the country during his next term.
