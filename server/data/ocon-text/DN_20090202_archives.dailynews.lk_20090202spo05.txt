Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse NewspapersThe International Cricket Council Sunday decided to relocate the 2009 Champions Trophy from Pakistan due to lingering fears over the security situation in the troubled nation. Following a meeting of the ICC board here, chief executive Haroon Lorgat said the "safety and security environment" in Pakistan had forced a relocation of the eight-nation event. The second-biggest one-day tournament in world cricket behind the World Cup, the Champions Trophy had already been delayed 12 months to September this year because of concerns over player safety. "The board was seeking some sort of certainty sooner rather than later, and as a result has decided it won't be staged in Pakistan," Lorgat said. "We all know what is transpiring in Pakistan and India has now got a government directive not to tour, which adds some weight to the countries who had previously indicated they were not keen to tour Pakistan," he added. "It is unfortunate the Champions Trophy will not take place in Pakistan due to circumstances completely beyond the control of the PCB (Pakistan Cricket Board)," Lorgat said. Despite the change of venue, Pakistan will still earn a hosting fee, the ICC said. Sri Lanka is the alternative venue and Lorgat said a final decision would be made on the tournament before the next ICC board meeting in April. "The alternate nominee is Sri Lanka," Lorgat said. "There are just a few things we want to iron out before we confirm that particular as the alternate host." Sri Lankan officials have repeatedly said they are ready to host the tournament.But disappointed former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja insisted the nation had done enough to reassure the world that cricket was not a target for terrorists.
