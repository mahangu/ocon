A Sub Inspector of Police and two constables attached to the Anuradhapura Police Station, were among a number of suspects interrogated by the Crime Division of the North Central Province in connection with the sale of spurious 'gold' coins purported to belong to an ancient era. The coins were discovered during a treasure hunt, the racketeers claimed. But all had been turned out of iron washers, police said.

Two suspects were arrested on Monday evening at Anuradhapura town after a transaction involving more than one million rupees with a contractor of Dehiattakandiya in Polonnaruwa. The racketeers had sold him a bag of the fake gold coins, police said.

The arrests were made following information received by the North Central DIG Jayantha Jayasinghe. He deployed the OIC of the special crime branch IP A. A.Buddhadasa and SI M.K. Dharmasena to the investigation.

Police also recovered 3 kilos of fake gold coins, turned out of iron washers, 3 kilo of iron washers and equipment used to convert the washers into 'gold' coins. The suspects were in the 28 and 30 age group and residents of Wanniyankulama and Nellikulama

They had sold the coins to the Dehiattakandiya contractor on December 11, who soon discovered that he had been duped. After failing to trace the two suspects he had narrated the story to the DIG.

Investigations also revealed the 'factory' where they were turned out in the cemetery at Wijepura in Anuradhapura.

The suspects revealed that the fake gold coins had been sold in Kandy, Kegalle, Anuradhapura and Dehiattakandaya and an SI and two PCs attached to the Anuradhapura Police had aided and abetted them to carry on the racket. It is suspected that the two suspects had made millions through the racket.

The three policemen had been transferred out of Anuradhapura and an internal inquiry has been initiated against the trio.
