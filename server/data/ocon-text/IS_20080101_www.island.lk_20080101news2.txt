The dawn of a New Year is a time for new expectations and resolutions. We hope changes that would occur in this New Year will have a favourable impact on the lives of all our people, President Mahinda Rajapaksa said in his New Year message to the nation issued yesterday.

He added: "There is an expectation that we would come closer to overcoming the main problems that face us as a nation. Our foremost with this New Year is success in the efforts to defeat terrorism in all its forms, bringing more freedom and democracy to all

Sri Lankans; and beginning new processes for the sharing of power within a single, undivided country, assuring equality to all.

We also look forward to greater economic development that is equitably spread throughout the country to help raise the living standards of our people, which would take our country to a new threshold of progress, where the fruits of economic growth can be shared by the widest sectors of our society.

"I share with you the hope that the New Year will bring peace to our country and build greater understanding and trust among the people; in a society where tolerance and traditional values that have been the strength of our society for centuries will prevail in the face of new challenges ahead.
