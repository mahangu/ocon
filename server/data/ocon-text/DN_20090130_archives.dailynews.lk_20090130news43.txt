A sum of Rs. 19 million was granted as compensation to 17 people who lost their lands and property which they had earned through hard work for a number of years, due to the Deduruoya Water Supply Scheme.

"We have to implement such projects for the benefit of the future generation. This can be considered as a noble donation made by them, Minister of Nation Building Salinda Dissanayake said at a function held at the Ganewatta D.S. office in order to grant compensation to 17 persons who lost their lands due to the water supply project.

The people dreamt of a water supply scheme for a long time and on the other hand they were also worried about losing their lands and property. But we try our best to grant them every possible assistance as instructed by the President. We have even amended some existing rules and regulations in order to grant them relief.

Director of the Deduruoya Water Supply Scheme W.L.H.W.T. Bandara said that it had been planned to complete the entire work on this project within three years. All the Members of Parliament and the Ministers in the Kurunegala district and the State officials extended their co-operation to make our effort a success.

The speciality of this project is that we have utilised the local technology for it.

This is a great encouragement to all of us who had received free education. We express our sincere thanks to the President and the Minister of Irrigation who guided us in the correct path, he added.
