December 31 2008: Bad weather forced the opening one-day international between New Zealand and the West Indies to be abandoned in Queenstown.

Only 35.4 overs were possible before rain brought an early end to proceedings shortly before 3pm local time with the West Indies on 129 for five.

Rain had been a feature from the very start with the players called off the ground after the opening over, then again in the 14th before play was suspended for a third and final time midway through the 36th over.

Xavier Marshall was unbeaten on 29 and Denesh Ramdin was on three when play was called off.

Ramnaresh Sarwan top-scored with 38 for the tourists who were inserted in overcast conditions after New Zealand skipper Daniel Vettori won the toss and opted to bowl first.

The West Indies struggled from the start in the miserable weather with boundaries at a premium for the usually flamboyant Chris Gayle.

The West Indies skipper finally perished to a poor caught behind decision when on 25 to leave the tourists on 42 for two and it was left to Sarwan and Marshall to push the score beyond the 100-run mark.

But when Sarwan was caught behind by Brendon McCullum after he bottom edged a Vettori delivery, it sparked a West Indies collapse as they slumped from 102 for three to 129 for five when play was abandoned.

Tim Southee was the pick of the New Zealand bowlers with figures of two for 33 off 7.4 overs, while Vettori was his usual miserly self with one for 26 off eight overs.

Shivnarine Chanderpaul was absent from the West Indies line-up because of a hand injury.

The next one-dayer is in Christchurch on Saturday.

Toss: New Zealand, who chose to field first
