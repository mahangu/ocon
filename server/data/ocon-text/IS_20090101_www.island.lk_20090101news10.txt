While announcing an all round reduction on the price of petrol by Rs. 2 and a conditional Rs. 20 subsidy for three wheeler taxis, the government said that it cannot comment on the Supreme Court directive to reduce the price from Rs.122 to 100.

Enterprise Development and Investments Promotions Minister Sarath Amunugama, when questioned at Tuesday's Cabinet press briefing in Colombo, on the governments response to Opposition statements that non-compliance with the Supreme Court order tantamounts to contempt of court, said, "We don't want to comment on a judicial matter."

Media Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa said that Tuesday's briefing was held to announce the government's economic stimulus package and requested that questions be limited to the economy.

The government, last week said that it had three weeks time to respond to the December 17 Supreme Court directive, pertaining to the pricing of petrol.

It maintains that the imposition of taxes were unavoidable and that it was not bound by judicial orders on the pricing of consumer goods and services.

However, Opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe said earlier this week that the Constitution prohibits unreasonable taxation and on that principle the government was bound to implement the Supreme Court directive.
