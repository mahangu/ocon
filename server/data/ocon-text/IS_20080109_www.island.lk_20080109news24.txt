Government Defence Spokesman Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, making a statement in Parliament yesterday, said his interview with the BBC Sandeshaya had been taken out of context and used to imply that he blamed the EPDP for the assassination of parliamentarian T. Maheswaran.

At the beginning of the interview, answering a leading question, he told the BBC that the suspect had served as a security officer of the EPDP previously, but later in the interview he had explained that the suspect was now under investigation and there appeared to be an LTTE connection with the suspect. What he said was that the police investigations are continuing, but he did not say at any stage that the EPDP was responsible for the assassination of Maheswaran as the investigations were pointing towards an LTTE question. It should not be construed that his interview pointed a finger of accusation at anyone but gave the facts as they were, Rambukwella said.

He said that some elements were using the interview taking only one remark he made to give it a twist in their own favour but he had not made any allegation against anyone as the police investigations were not concluded up to now.
