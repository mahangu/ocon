I was disheartened to read that bus travellers had thought it fit to air their grievance that bus conductors do not refund a rupee once they tender a ten rupee note for a Rs. 9/- fare. Let us view this problem dispassionately. The facts as stated are true and there is no dispute on this score.

Who should shoulder the blame for this imbroglio? There are two parties involved - the conductors and the passengers. A hapless conductor on a working day may have to contend with a minimum of 400 passengers even if he runs four return trips. Can any reasonable person expect him to start the day with 400 rupee coins ready to proffer to these passengers who conveniently offer notes? From where could this conductor find coins on a regular basis? Certainly not from any bank, and not from any beggars who treat small denominations with contempt - (and let the donor know it!).

Let us concede that the responsibility rests squarely on the passengers to find the correct fare - or keep silent if the balance coin is not returned. We as a nation love to complain and grumble - let us be grateful that conductors give us an opportunity to indulge in this exercise. With the shortage of coins soon, 'Maru salli" will be called 'Amaru salli".
