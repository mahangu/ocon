National Livestock Development Board (NLDB) has embarked on upgrading the Ridiyagama Farm in order to provide fresh buffalo curd to residents in Colombo.

Until 1990, the Ridiyagama Farm was managed by the state, and then handed over to the NLDB. "The NLDB, at first, could not manage the buffalo curd project efficiently due to a number of factors such as various policy matters etc. and the country lost good quality curd. From this year onwards, the farm will restart its work on a restructured basis and will be catering to city people at its fullestpotential," said NLDB Deputy Chairman Roshan Gunawardena.

Ridiyagama buffalo curd was, in the past, synonymous for quality and taste. "Today, Colombo gets buffalo curd from various regions and much of it flavoured artificially with various essences. Our effort through this venture is to provide curd in its fresh, natural form to Colombo consumers," reiterated Gunawardena.

He said that the farm has sufficient resources to meet the Colombo curd demand.

Plans are afoot to start the project at end January 2008. Initially 300 litres of buffalo curd per day will be sold in Colombo. "We will be able to increase the capacity to 2000 litre by the end of this year," assured Gunawardena.

According to him, one pot of curd will be priced at Rs 110, which is well below the market price.

Also the attractive looking pots containing buffalo curd could be used for other purposes once the curd is consumed.
