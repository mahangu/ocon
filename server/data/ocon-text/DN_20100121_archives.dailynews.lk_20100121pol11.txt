Academics to support President

M. P. Muttiah

The academic community extends its unequivocal support to President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the Presidential election next week. At a press conference held at the Government Information Department, University Grants Commission Chairman Professor Gamini Samaranayake said that the academic community highly appreciated the fulfillment of aspirations of all peoples in this country by the President, irrespective of any distinction, in achieving peace and laying the foundation for greater prosperity and development.

The UGC Chairman said that they had recognised the guidance and leadership given by the President to defeat LTTE terrorism without succumbing to international pressure. He warned that treacherous moves are afoot both nationally and internationally to bring discredit to the country through war crime charges against valiant soldiers and commanders. There are forces that try to turn the clock backwards by encouraging again the separatist political tendencies and divisions among various communities.

He alleged that attempts were being made to pave the way for a possible military dictatorship by completely undermining the democratic institutions and practices developed since 1931.

Professor Samaranayake said that the academic community's considered view is that having only military experience, however successful it may be, is not only insufficient for the office of President but also dangerous given the current volatile political situation, he added.

He requested the public to weigh the facts carefully, make their choice intelligently and vote for Mahinda Rajapaksa unequivocally.

Vice Chancellors, Rectors, Directors and Heads of educational institutions as well as professors and others addressed the press briefing.
