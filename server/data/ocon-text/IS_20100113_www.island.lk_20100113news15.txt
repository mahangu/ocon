CHENNAI: Police in the southern Indian state of Tamilnadu have launched a hunt for a Sri Lankan national, allegedly involved in a fake currency case.

Indian media reported that a leading private bank handed over a bundle of counterfeit notes detected from the deposit made a customer to the police at Virugambakkam in Tamilnadu on Saturday.

Police, quoted by Express Buzz, said Bharat Media owner Kothamangalam Tamizh, residing in Balaji Nagar, Virugambakkam, came to the local branch of ICICI Bank around 11.30am and deposited Rs520,000 at the counter.

The bank staff detected 200 fake notes of Rs 500 denomination, with a face value of Rs 100,000, in the currency bundle.

Branch manager Kishore Kumar deposited the counterfeit notes at the local police station and lodged a complaint against Kothamangalam Tamizh, who was arrested for questioning.

He reportedly told police that he received the money from his friend Selvanayagam, a real estate businessman.

Police zeroed in on Selvanayagam, who, in turn, claimed that he got the money from a Sri Lankan Tamil in connection with the sale of land. When the Sri Lankan Tamil was contacted, he reportedly said he received the amount through money transfer from Switzerland and denied any involvement in the counterfeit currency racket.

Since he failed to appear for inquiry, police have launched a search for him, said the report.
