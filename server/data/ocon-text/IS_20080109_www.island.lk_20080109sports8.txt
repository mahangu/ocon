MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) - India's beleaguered cricketers got good news on two fronts - their suspended spin bowler can play until a hearing is held to discuss his appeal, and the umpire they complained vociferously about won't officiate in the next test.

International Cricket Council president Malcolm Speed said Tuesday that a hearing into the India-lodged appeal of Harbjajan Singh's three-test ban on a racism charge will likely be held before the next test, which is scheduled from Jan. 16 in Perth.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India has suspended its tour pending the outcome of Harbhajan's appeal hearing.

Speed said if the hearing was not held before the start of the Perth match, Harbhajan would be eligible to play in the third test.

Speed also said West Indian umpire Steve Bucknor will be replaced by New Zealand's Billy Bowden. India had demanded Bucknor be removed from the third test following the team's anger towards his performance in the second test in Sydney, where up to five questionable decisions went against them in the match they lost by 122 runs.

Speed acknowledged some people would be unhappy because India had requested Bucknor be stood down.

"I can understand that people will take that view," he said. "It is an extraordinary set of circumstances and we want to take some of the tension out of the situation."

India's players tried to take some tension out as well - playing beach volleyball with lifesavers at Sydney's iconic Bondi beach earlier Tuesday.
