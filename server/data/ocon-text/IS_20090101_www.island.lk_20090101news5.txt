Kandy â€“ The general opinion that Muslims in Sri Lanka are green in politics is a wrong concept. There is sufficient evidence to prove that a large segment of Muslims are not with the United National Party (UNP), Foreign Employment Promotion and Welfare Minister Keheliya Rambukwella said at the opening of an election office for Dr. Alhaj A. L. M. Uvais, the UPFA candidate, for the Central provincial Council Election.

The office was opened at No. 48, Hill Street, Kandy.

"All Muslims are not UNP supporters. A large section of the Muslims have pledged to support President Mahinda Rajapaksa to crush LTTE terrorism," Rambukwella said.

The Muslims have not forgotten that the LTTE terrorists masescred hundreds of their people in the North and East and the killing of civilian Muslims in prayer in the Mosques in the East, he said.

"President Mahinda Rajapaksa came to the rescue of the Muslims in the North and East.

The Muslims knowing well the steps taken by him are now rallying round him to strengthen his arms to rout out LTTE terrorism."

Minister Rambukwella said the elections to the two Provincial Councils of Central and North Western are not mere Provincial Councils Elections. There was a special significance in the elections to the two Provincial Councils.

A victory at the two Provincial Councils is a victory for the Mahinda Rajapaksa-led government and will give the President moral support to bring to an end the war and capture the ruthless LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, he said.

It would even be possible to capture Prabhakaran and deal with him under the laws of the country after the elections on February 07, he said.
