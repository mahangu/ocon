The Petition filed by the Teleshan Network Private Limited, and a few other Television stations against some impending regulations on licensing was called before the Supreme Court yesterday and was re-fixed for calling again on March 2, 2009.

The TNL, the MTV, and the Dialog TV submitted through their respective counsel, that their observations had not been taken into account, so far, in redrafting the new regulations. The Court allowed the parties further time to hold discussions on the issue.

Senior State Council N. G. Pulle said that the Ministry will, try to consider, the observations as far as possible, in reformulating the new regulations for licencing.

The petitioners had complained against the gazetted regulations which needed the approval of the media minister on Technical, financial and professional grounds for renewing a Telecasting, broadcasting licence. They said this was unfair by TV stations which had invested in licencing to be called upon to obtain a re-licence, within a short period of time.

At an earlier hearing the court suspended this gazette until the final determination of this petition.
