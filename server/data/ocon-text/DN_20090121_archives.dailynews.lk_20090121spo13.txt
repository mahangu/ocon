Kandy SC will field star-studded Rugby Sevens team

Ranjeeva SENEVIRATNE

Kandy Sports Club which has reigned supreme in 'sevens' rugby for the last seven years will field another star studded outfit for the Club Rugby Sevens which will be worked off on February 7 and 8 at Nittawela and February 28 and March 1 at Longdon place.

Last year the lads from Kandy clinched the Dialog Professional Sevens by beating Army by the staggering margin of 55-7 at Nittawela in the finals of the First Leg and scored a smashing 41-12 win over Air Force in the final of the Second Leg at Longdon Place to make it seven in a row.

This year Sri Lanka Centre Pradeep Liyanage has been entrusted with the task of leading the Kandy SC sevens team.

Liyanage had the honour of leading the Sri Lanka sevens team at the Hong Kong sevens in March 2008 and World Cup qualifying sevens in Hong Kong in October 2008.

The Kandy SC 'Sevens' outfit will be laden with national players in Saliya Kamera, Fazil Marija, Sanjeeva Jayasinghe, Gayan Weeraratne, Dilip Salvam, Sean Wijesinghe, Skipper Pradeep Liyanage and Chamara Withanage (who makes a welcome return to the side after serving a one-year ban for allegedly assaulting a player after the Trinity-Kingswood match in June 2007).

The lads from Kandy here been bolstered by the inclusion of two top 'sevens' players - CR and FC and Sri Lanka centre Mohamed Sheriff and Isipatana and CH and FC Flanker Sajith Saranga who had the honour of representing Sri Lanka as a schoolboy last year at the World Cup qualifying sevens. The lads from Kandy here been training hard at Nittawela during the last few days and are confident of retaining the club Rugby Sevens title for a record eighth successive year since the inception of the tournament in 1977.
