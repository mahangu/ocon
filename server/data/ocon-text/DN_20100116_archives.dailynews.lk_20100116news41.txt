Lankan faces 10 years jail in UK for 'eBay for fraudsters' scam

Sri Lankan born Renukanth Subramaniam, 33, faces a 10 years prison sentence after admitting he helped create the notorious Dark Marked forum for computer crimes. Subrammiam, former Pizza delivery man in London was unmasked as the mastermind behind a Pound 100 million fraud that threatened every bank account and credit card holder in Britain.

Despite his itinerant lifestyle he is thought to have made millions himself, but investigators have yet to trace the fortune of a man who lived so modestly to avoid detection.

From the Java Bean internet cafe in Wembley, North London, Subramaniam ran an extraordinary global criminal network dubbed "eBay for fraudsters" which was responsible for the raiding of bank accounts worldwide.

His site, called Dark Market, acted as an online marketplace for villains to trade victims' credit card information such as PIN numbers, answers to bank account security questions and even passwords for social networking websites.

The "one-stop shop" for fraudsters sold 10 credit card numbers for around pounds 30 and offered tutorials to teach others how to compromise internet bank accounts, commit identity fraud, money laundering and even scams targeting retail and gaming industries.

The sophisticated site featured breaking news-style updates on the latest stolen bank details available for purchase. Its products included equipment to clone ATM cards.

More than 2,500 criminals from around the world subscribed to what was considered the leading English-language website for trading stolen financial information. - Daily Mail
