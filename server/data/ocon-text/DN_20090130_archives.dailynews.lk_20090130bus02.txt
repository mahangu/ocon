Nokia pledges more investments

Sri Lanka is one of the most lucrative markets for Nokia and the company continues to invest in the local market.

Sales and Channel Development Manager, Nokia EA Md. Mesbahuddin, said that Nokia will continue to invest in Sri Lanka as it is an important market compared to other markets in the region.

The local telecommunication industry is equipped with 3G and 3.5G. The local industry is fast in adopting the latest technologies, which creates immense business opportunities for Nokia, he said.

Nokia will invest heavily on brand building, market research and improve the retail business in the Sri Lankan market.

Investing on market surveys is important to identify local customer needs and the latest trends in the market and Nokia will focus more on this, he said. Gray market exists in every market and it is difficult to eliminate the gray market completely.

However, the industry needs the assistance from the government to mitigate the gray market.

The local tax rate on mobile phones is still high and bringing the tax rate down will make mobile phones more affordable to customers where it will prevent customers moving towards the gray market, he said. Nokia launched its first branded store in Sri Lanka on Wednesday. This store offers an extensive range of Nokia devices and accessories with expert advice and the assurance of authenticity.

Retail Development Manager, Nokia EA Sajid Rizwan Matin said that during an economic downturn companies need to continue their investments. But they have to prioritise their investments.

Investing on retail business is important and the Nokia branded store is part of enhancing our retail business in Sri Lanka.

"We expect to invest more on Nokia stores in Sri Lanka and these stores will be located out of Colombo", he said.
