The North Central Provincial Councillors came under severe criticism on Wednesday by the JVP because the Council sessions could not be held during the post lunch session for want of quorum.

The sessions were held in the pre-lunch session but after adjournment for lunch the Council lacked quorum and the meeting had to be adjourned, JVP Council leader R. K. Indrananda said.

Commenting on the lack of interest of the councillors, he said the Council meets once a fortnight just for four hours, but even these meagre sessions cannot be conducted for lack of quorum. The councillors receive over Rs 100,000 a month as salaries and other perks but this is how they look after problems of the people who elected them to the North Central Province, Indraratane complained.

At the opening sessions of the Council for the current year, the Governor proudly spelt out several proposals, in his policy statement, for the welfare of the people of the NCP and the councillors by absenting themselves are making a mockery of the Governor's policy, Indraratne said.

Farmers and other villagers severely affected by the recent floods have so far not been compensated nor any concrete steps taken to solve their problems. During the floods the councillors visited the affected villagers and assured relief measures

On Wednesday afternoon two important proposals, compensation for flood victims and the restoration of Samurdhi benefits to those who had been deprived of it, were to be taken up for discussions but unfortunately the Council could not be convened for lack of quorum, Indraratane said.

"It is disappointing to see that the discipline of Councillors has deteriorated to such a low level" the JVP Council leader said.
