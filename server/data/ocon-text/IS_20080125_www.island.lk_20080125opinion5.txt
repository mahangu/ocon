Tipplers ask no quarter and expect no quarter. So the distillers should honour the contents of the bottle as described on the label.

I bought two bottles of Old Arrack from a reputed Super Market for Rs. 1210.00, two days before Christmas. On opening I found in one Old Arrack, but in the other the ordinary Special Arrack. Both were same colour. The contents seem 75% H2O. I have been drinking since 1947, when a bottle of good Coconut Arrack was Rs. 6.00 and know the taste well.

To Whisky drinkers, arrack drinkers are abominable and antisocial, but hundreds of bars, taverns, clubs, sports clubs and wine shops located all over the country belie their beliefs.

It seems tipplers, have no consumer or standard protection, but contribute billions to the treasury by way of excise duty.

In early sixties there were only five taverns from Kollupitiya to Hambanthota. Now there are hundreds in every nook and corner, but some politicians say alcohol consumption has decreased!
