Former Chief Justice Sarath Nanda Silva on Tuesday said that he had entered the Presidential election scene to help amend the Constitution.

Addressing a meeting at the Sanasa Auditorium in Matara, he said "There are several attractions in the post of executive president which makes one to be attracted to it. Once you are installed in it you do not feel like giving it up

The former Chief Justice said that this was the opportune time to decide whether to continue with the executive presidency or to abolish it. He was sure that General Sarath Fonseka, if he wins the election, would abolish the executive presidency.

"Even American President Barak Obama does not have powers to make an MP quit his party and offer him a ministerial portfolio. But in our country it is possible. Even President J. R. Jayewardene did not misuse the Constitutional powers he was entitled to," he said.

When President Rajapaksa, in his capacity as Minister of Finance, presents the Budget in Parliament, he cannot be questioned, he said.

The former Chief Justice said that a parliamentarian is entitled to a pension after serving for five years, whereas a Government servant has to serve at least ten years to be entitled to a pension.

"If an MP crosses over to another political party a re-election should be held. But today we do not have such regulations and this has endangered democracy,", he said.
