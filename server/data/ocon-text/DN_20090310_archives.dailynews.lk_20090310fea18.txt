Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse NewspapersThe leaf tips bend 

 under the weight of dew. 

 Fruits are ripening 

 in Earth's early morning. 

 Daffodils light up in the sun. 

 The curtain of cloud at the gateway 

 of the garden path begins to shift: 

 have pity for childhood, 

 the way of illusion.

Late at night, 

 the candle gutters. 

 In some distant desert, 

 a flower opens. 

 And somewhere else, 

 a cold aster 

 that never knew a cassava patch 

 or gardens of areca palms, 

 never knew the joy of life, 

 at that instant disappears 

 man's eternal yearning.
