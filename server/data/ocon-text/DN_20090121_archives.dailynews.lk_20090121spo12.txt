Price shines in Zimbabwe's win over Bangladesh

Veteran Raymond Price grabbed 4-22 and hit two boundaries in the last over to lead Zimbabwe to an exciting two-wicket win over Bangladesh in the first one-day international here on Monday.

The 32-year-old recorded his career-best figures and then scored a match-winning 24 not out as Zimbabwe surpassed Bangladesh's modest 124 with four balls to spare. Paceman Mashrafe Mortaza (3-21) and spinner Shakib Al Hasan (3-11) picked three wickets each to reduce Zimbabwe to 92-8, before debutant Malcolm Waller (24) and Price crushed the home team's victory bid.

It was Zimbabwe's second successive win over Bangladesh, having beaten the hosts by 38 runs in the recent tri-series in Dhaka that also featured Sri Lanka.
