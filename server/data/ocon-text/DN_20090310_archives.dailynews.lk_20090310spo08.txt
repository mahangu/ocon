Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse NewspapersBritish sprinter Dwain Chambers could face sanctions from the sport's world governing body for his autobiography detailing his use of performance-enhancing drugs.

The International Association of Athletics Federations said Monday that its legal experts will study the book and consider whether Chambers should be punished for "bringing the sport into disrepute." The case will come up at an IAAF meeting in Berlin this month. Chambers won the 60 meters at the European indoor championships in Turin, Italy, on Sunday for his first major individual title since serving a two-year ban in the BALCO doping scandal.

His victory was largely overshadowed in Britain by the fallout from his book, "Race Against Me: My Story." The autobiography, which has been serialized in the British media, went on sale Monday.

In the book, Chambers said he was a "walking junkie" who took more than 300 different concoctions of banned substances after linking up with BALCO founder Victor Conte in 2002. He said the doping products - including THG, EPO and HGH - cost him $30,000 a year. LONDON, AP
