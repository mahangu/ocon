Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse NewspapersThe country's economy will experience a new boom immediately after the eradication of terrorism, Urban Development and Scared Area Development Minister Dinesh Goonwardene said.

He was speaking at a ceremony at Bambarakale Maha Viharaya, Nuwara Eliya last Friday.

The ceremony was held to felicitate the community based organisations operating drinking water service projects in the catchment areas under the aegis of the second Community Water Supply and Security Projects undertaken by the Urban Development and Sacred Area Development Ministry.

The Minister said although the main hydro resources originate from the hill country, the people specially the low income groups section face immense difficulties in producing clean drinking water.

This project is the result of the guidance shown by President Mahinda Rajapaksa who identified the value of such water services projects in the hill-country.

Under the Mahinda Chinthanaya concept, rural economy based on development activities from the available resources is given pride of place, the Minister said.

These projects if implemented by village based organisations will bring about a huge boost to the country's economy. The Government is always prepared to lend assistance to such ventures, Minister Goonewardene said.

Youth Affairs Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi said people in the most difficult areas in Nuwara-Eliya district can access clean water only through this kind of projects initiated by Urban Development Ministry.

Late Minister Philip Goonawardene did a yeoman service to cultivators in this district by banning the import of seed potato long ago, Minister Wanniarachchi said.

Shanthipura Viharadhipathi Ven. Mathugama Sobitha Thera, Ports Development Minister Dilan Perera, National Director of the Project W. Piyasena were also present.
