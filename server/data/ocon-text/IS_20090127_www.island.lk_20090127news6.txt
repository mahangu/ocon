Sabaragamuwa Chief Minister Maheepala Herath said, the government has released a sum of Rs. 750 million to the Provincial Council to develop all the rural roads and by-roads in the Ratnapura and Kegalle districts.

He was addressing a meeting held at the Community Hall at Galigamuwa Uravulla, in the Kegalle district after a tour of inspection of the work carried out on the Ambanpitiya-Uravulla road under the Jathika Saviya and Gama Neguma Programmes. He was satisfied with the concrete roads and said that concrete should be used in all rural road building in the future.

He said people elect their representatives not to satisfy individuals but to serve the entire community. Those who wish only to eat, drunk and enjoy life are not worthy to be people's representatives, he said.
