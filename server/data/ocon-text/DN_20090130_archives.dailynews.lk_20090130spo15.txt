Powell backs Windies firepower to blast out England

Daren Powell believes West Indies have the firepower to overcome England 3-0 in their Test series in the Caribbean.

The West Indies fast bowler made the prediction a week before the first Test at Sabina Park in his native Jamaica, and is looking forward to playing a big role.

"I am definitely looking for a 3-0 series win over England in the Test series, and we are going to beat them also in the one-day series," Powell confidently told the Jamaica Observer newspaper.

"(England) made some comments about us after our last tour of England, following our success in the one-day series that they could not wait to return to the Caribbean.

"I am fit and ready to go, and I know that my teammates are anxious to prove that we are good enough to beat them."

But Powell is fortunate to have been selected.

He has taken 79 wickets at 46.22 runs apiece in 32 Tests, and a number of on-field incidents during the recent series in New Zealand have not helped his cause.

"I have more confidence in what I do now," he said. "It is up to me to go back to the nets and sharpen up for the challenges ahead. I want to improve my game even further and get more wickets. He added: "I would like to see the West Indies continue to improve their form coming off the tour of New Zealand and stay as focussed as we were as a team.

"Unity was responsible for the team's success in New Zealand. The guys are working better as a unit and fully understand their roles."

England have won their last four Test series against West Indies and 13 of their last 17 Tests against the hosts.
