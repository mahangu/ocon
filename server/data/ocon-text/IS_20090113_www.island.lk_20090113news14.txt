Minister of Social Services and Social Welfare and Secretary General of EPDP Douglas Devananda, ina statement on the attack of the 'Sirasa' Media Institution and the brutal slaying of Lasantha Wickrematunga, has stated "At a time a war is waged against terrorism, the media needs to act responsibly exercising care and caution paying due concern to the society we live in. Similarly, barbaric acts such as; attacks on media institution and assassination of media personnel should be condoned under no circumstance."

"Any person in the society should have the freedom to express his or her ideas while freedom also should be in existence for anyone to express alternate ideas in response. Ideas need to be met with ideas, but the culture of meeting ideas with arms should be condemned with disgust. Suppressing ideas with weapons on the one hand reflects inability and inefficiency and on the other cowardliness.

"Banning newspaper circulation, threatening, attacking media institutions and assassinating media personnel are crimes against free expression of ideas that's tantamount to asphyxiating the very freedom of expression. This can never be condoned the Minister said.

He also said that the recent attack on 'MTV/Sirasa' Institution and the brutal murder of Lasantha Wickrematunga, the Editor of Sunday Leader newspaper, have sent shock waves thought the country.
