Ananda, St. Joseph's, St. Peter's and Wesley are the only colleges from Colombo to have secured places in the quarter finals of the on-going Inter School Under-13 Division I Astra Cup championship which will commence its most competitive stage on Saturday.

St. Sylvester's College, Kandy, Dharmasoka College, Ambalangoda, De Mazenod College, Kandana and Maliyadeva College, Kurunegala are the outstation schools who have found spots in quarter-finals in Division I.

Meanwhile, all defending champions in Division I, II, and III of the Inter School Under-13 tournament have failed to reach the quarter finals.

Defending champions in the Division I, II and III, namely, St. Sebastian's College Moratuwa, Royal College, Panadura and St. Anthony's College, Wattala, couldn't achieve the points needed to book a place in the quarter-finals.

This year, the tournament was played under a new league format which saw each successful team in the first round play in a relatively large second round league in several groups.

The quarter finals will commence with the Division III quarter final between Royal College Colombo and Ananda Sastralaya, Kotte on Friday.
