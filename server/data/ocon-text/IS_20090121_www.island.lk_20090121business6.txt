Colombo's cozy hang-out and much loved Coffee House, 'The Commons', takes on the New Year with an exciting and invigorating Milkshake Promotion. Kicking off on Sunday 18 January until the end of the month, the thirst quenching array on offer includes 'Fresh Strawberry Milkshake', 'Chocolate Espresso Mint Shake', 'Avocado Milkshake', 'Chocolate Brownie Milkshake', 'Classic Caramel Milkshake', etc. In addition to these variants, which will be served both small and large, will also be the in-house, off-the-traditional-menu milkshakes such as Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry, Honey, Coffee, Mango and Banana. A 'milkshakexperience' at 'The Commons' will be the ideal way to keep cool and chill out, at the coziest hang-out in Colombo, with friends, foes, family and everyone else in between.

There's also a Hopper Fiesta after 6.00 pm daily at the Commons with Egg Hoppers and Plain Hoppers with Chicken, Fish or Vegetable Curry and Seeni Sambol and Katta Sambol. Meanwhile the "Rotti Cart on Wheels" with its delightful range of flavours, aromas and fillings, is also available as an 'action station' for private functions in Colombo.
