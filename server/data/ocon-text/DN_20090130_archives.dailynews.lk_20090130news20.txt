Two Tiger detained UN expats flee without local staff

Two UN expatriates, detained by Tigers in un-cleared areas, north of Puthukkudiyiruppu for more than 10 days escaped yesterday afternoon without their 13 local employees, the Army Headquarters said.

Two UN expatriates on January 16 along with their local staff travelled to the Vanni to deliver urgent food and emergency supplies to the displaced. Tiger terrorists refused to allow them to return from the Wanni after the delivery of items, which prompted the UN office to lodge the 'strongest possible protest to the LTTE' in a special communique issued on January 22 after repeated attempts to secure their release failed.

One of the detained UN expatriates, Haroon after escaping from the LTTE detention, visited the Vanni Security Forces Headquarters and met Major General Jagath Jayasuriya, Commander, Security Forces Headquarters in the Vanni.
