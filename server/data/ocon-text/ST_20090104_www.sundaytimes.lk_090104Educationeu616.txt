Professional Customer Service Programme for School LeaversPersonality Development Institute is offering a one month intensive programme leading to 'Certificate in Professional Customer Service and Telephone Handling'. This course will benefit school leavers who wish to seek employment in customer service, marketing, reception and telephone handling positions. 

 The institute is making plans to arrange for practical training in leading private sector companies to provide the much needed initial practical experience.

A spokesman for the institute said this course of studies in customer service will provide a competitive advantage to school leavers who are looking for employment in the private sector. The objective of this programme is to equip school leavers with both theoretical and practical knowledge in providing customer service.

Commenting on the course, Mr. Rienzie de Mel of PRN Consultants, a leading recruitment agency said this programme of studies is specifically advantageous to employers as they can now recruit trained customer service executives which is a great benefit as untrained front-line customer contact staff not only makes costly service errors but also cut a bad image for the company.

He also said employers always prefer trained staff as it will save much costs as the companies don't have to spend money on sending their new recruits for training. This course will commence on January 19 and will be held at Personality Development Institute Auditorium in Colombo 5.
