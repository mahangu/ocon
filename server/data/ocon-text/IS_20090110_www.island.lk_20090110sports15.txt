Amith Thilakaratne's all-round heroics failed to bring victory to Sri Rahula College Katugastota over Karandeniya Central College in their drawn inter-school cricket tournament match that concluded at the University Grounds in Peradeniya on Thursday.

Left-arm-wrist spinner Amith Thilakratne who took a match bag of 10 for 107 and then hit 24 and 68 almost ensured a Sri Rahula victory, but at the end, they fell short by 14 runs.
