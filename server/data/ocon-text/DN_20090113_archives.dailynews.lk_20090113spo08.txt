Ethiopian star joins Boston Indoor field

Ethiopian Tirunesh Dibaba, who claimed double Olympic gold at 5,000 and 10,000 meters at Beijing, will run at the Boston Indoor Games on February 7, organizers announced Thursday.

Dibaba, the only woman two capture two athletics gold medals last August in China, has twice broken the women's world 5,000m indoor record at this meet and set an outdoor 5,000m world record last year at the Bislett Games in Oslo.
