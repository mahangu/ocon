Premier SC gets a boost

At a function held at Pedris Park recently, football gear worth over Rs 200,000 was handed over to Premier Football Club in Thimbirigasyaya. The team is led by S. Sathisthara, an 18 year old youth from Jaffna and are the current Division 2 champions.

Sathisthara, also represented the Sri Lanka National Football team at the recently concluded SAF games. The distribution of goods was made possible due to the kind generosity of Ajit Welihinda (former Trinitian/Senior Engineer and ardent football fan) now residing in UK.

Welihinda who is keen in promoting the game of football in Sri Lanka, indicated his willingness to sponsor a deserving team through his local contacts Jayantha Jayawardene (former Trinity Lion) and Charith Senanayake (Head of Marketing SLC)

After reviewing the current plight of the club, it was then decided to purchase full gear for the 25 members of the squad for the next season.

The Premier Football Club is represented by the youth from the area which consists of all nationalities.

They are currently trained by U.L. Nihal (former Saunders/Sri Lanka mid fielder) and assisted by Sumith Walpola, present national goal keeping coach.
