President, a man of the masses

Continued from yesterday

False election propaganda of discrimination against Tamil people under the administration of President Mahinda Rajapaksa stands contradicted and debunked by the personal conduct of the President and his public utterances and statements assuring equality for all citizens of Sri Lanka since his assumption of office in 2005.

Manifest proof of such harmony is demonstrated by the success story of Minister Muralitharan and world-renowned cricketer Muttiah Muralitharan who play their role as Sri Lankans and not as Tamils.

The time is opportune pursuant to the policy of President Mahinda Rajapaksa to create and foster the spirit of understanding and co-operation of all races and communities of Sri Lanka as one Nation and accept without division the concept of being Sri Lankan rather than perpetuating a racist and communal attitude.

This should commence by introducing legislation prohibiting the creation or banding together of any racial or communal organisation for any purpose including politics or sports. Prohibitive legislation should even require the disbanding of any such existing organisations or change of the name of such organisation demonstrating a racist or communal attitude.
