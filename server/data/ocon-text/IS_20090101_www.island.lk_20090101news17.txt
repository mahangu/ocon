"Never before has dawn of a New Year brought welcome expectations of unity and prosperity to our nation as we see today," President Mahinda Rajapaksa says in his New Year message.

He says: "We have great confidence that the path we have traversed so far will result in a sustainable peace for our country and people. I am aware that this will bring great joy to all of you. It is my firm belief that when our nation achieves victory it is the responsibility of us all to be united in safeguarding the future of our country. My government that has led the country on the correct path to development, while facing many challenges, has also taken the necessary steps to bring prosperity to the nation. We have honoured our brave and heroic troops engaged in the task of saving the country from terrorism by declaring 2009 as the 'Year of Heroic Victory'.

When the nation stands united all conspiracies against the country can be defeated. It is our resolve to strengthen the determination and commitment of our people towards making this New Year a truly victorious year for the nation."
