Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse NewspapersNFF to present way out of crisis The National Freedom Front (NFF) will soon present a comprehensive plan of action to avert the ill effects arising out of the global financial crisis. This action plan formulated by experts and professionals who have placed more confidence in the country's enormous potential in the alleviation of the ill effects of this crises, will be presented to the Government soon. Addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday, NFF leader Wimal Weerawansa said the country requires a broader alliance to fight the emerging impact of global financial crisis. He said the Government should get more involved in the nullifying of adverse repercussions arising out as result of global financial crisis. "The Government's intervention is a prerequisite in this regard," he said. We succeeded in harnessing the support of all segments of the country to fight the terrorism and the same pressure should be exerted to eradicate the ill effects of the global financial crises. "The country was not adversely affected by the global financial crisis because our economy was not based on export oriented agriculture. Most countries in the world which have placed much emphasis on export oriented agriculture have collapsed," he said. "It is learnt that the Central Bank is seeking a loan from the IMF to quell the emerging ill effects of the global financial crisis on conditions that may not be beneficial to the country," he said.
