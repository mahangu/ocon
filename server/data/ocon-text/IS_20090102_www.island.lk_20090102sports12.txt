The Island-SportsRANCHI: Indian skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni received yet another threat letter on Wednesday, by post, triggering an extraordinary security flurry and panic.

The letter, which arrived when Dhoni was at his Ranchi home, was addressed to his father Pan Singh and bore a title "levy patra". It threatened a fidayeen attack if Rs 50 lakh wasn't paid to the senders.

On December 29, the family had received a letter with a similar demand and Dhoni's family had handed it over to Ranchi police.

Both letters bear the signature of one Taslim who claims to be a shooter of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim in the Bihar-Jharkhand region. The letter, which has the address of a furniture store where the money is to be delivered, vows the attack will be carried out if the threat is disclosed to cops. Police said the underworld claims were yet to be verified.

"Dhoni is already entitled to Z-category security but additional forces have been deputed at his disposal," said Ranchi SSP Sampat Meena.

The Centre asked Jharkhand government to tighten security. Minister of state for home Sriprakash Jaiswal said he had asked the Jharkhand police chief to tighten Dhoni's security as a precautionary measure.

"The Jharkhand DGP has informed me that it could be the work of local miscreants. Still, I have asked him to increase and tighten Dhoni's security as a precautionary measure and keep in mind that no incident takes place."
