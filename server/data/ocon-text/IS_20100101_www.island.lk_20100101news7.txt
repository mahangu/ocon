Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) members, former Deputy Education Minister Murugan Sachinandan and R. Yogarajan, yesterday (Dec 31) said that more members would shortly join Opposition presidential candidate General (Rtd) Sarath Fonseka's campaign. They said the party leadership could not stop more desertions in the coming weeks ahead of the January 26 polls.

They pledged their support to Fonseka on Wednesday.

Sachinandan said several provincial councillors and senior members of the CWC would follow them. He told The Island that they quit the party which they had served for more than 30 years due to the top leadership's attitude towards senior members.

"I had had problems with the party leadership for some time due to injustices caused to us. Even during the recent elections for the Uva Provincial Council, our party leader Minister Arumugam Thondaman was more interested in his nephew's victory than in anything else. To help his man, he often sidelined seniors."

Yogarajan said that they had lost faith in the Rajapaksa administration, particularly over its handling of All Party Conference to tackle the ethnic issue. He emphasised the importance of working for the welfare of estate workers and Tamils of Indian origin.
