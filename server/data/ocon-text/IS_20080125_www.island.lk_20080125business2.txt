Adrenaline evaporates on the bourseSome of Wednesday's gains lost in Thursday trading

The adrenaline infused into the Colombo bourse following official hints that Prabhakaran may have been hurt in an air raid evaporated yesterday with both the All Share and Milanka price indices declining â€“ the All Share by 15.68 points (0.64%) while the Milanka lost 24.61 points (0.78%) on a turnover of Rs.100.4 million, down from Wednesday's Rs.232.1 million.

"The dip was not as sharp as the previous day's gains," Prashan Fernando of DFCC Stockbrokers said. "Most of the turnover yesterday came from John Keells Holdings (JKH)."

JKH saw over 0.4 million shares traded between Rs.123.50 and Rs.125 gaining Rs.1.25 on the VWA to close at Rs.123.75 contributing Rs.49.6 million to turnover.

Fernando said that two blocks of 150,000 shares each were crossed at a price of Rs.123 and the balance was done on the floor.

Ceylinco Insurance too saw some interest though less so than on Wednesday holding its Rs.180 price on 50,000 shares transacted flat.

Other counters demonstrating volume included Lanka Cement with slightly over 0.7 million shares traded between Rs.11 and Rs.12 losing 75 cents on the VWA to close ate Rs.11.

Reports that India's giant Birla group is looking at reviving the long non-operational Kankesanturai cement factory fuelled interest in this stock, brokers said.

The big gainer yesterday was Shaw Wallace where the price moved up by Rs.14.25 on a small quantity of 200 shares traded at Rs.174 and Ceylon Hotels Corporation (CHC) whose two-rupee share closed at Rs.60 on a trading range of Rs.55 to Rs.75 on 13,400 shares traded. CHC closed up Rs.11.25.

PMB lost Rs.7 on a trading range of Rs.58.50 to Rs.63.50 on 1,000 shares done while Elpitiya Plantations lost Rs.6.75 on 400 shares trading flat at Rs.66.

"Other than for JKH, the market was very dull," Fernando of DFCC Stockbrokers said.
