The United States has said it is deeply concerned about the escalating violence surrounding the upcoming presidential elections, particularly reports of today's fatal shooting. In a statement issued to the media, the US government said: "We urge the appropriate authorities to conduct a full investigation of this and other acts of violence and to protect those exercising their democratic right to support the candidate of their choice. This is the first nation-wide election in a peaceful, united Sri Lanka in several decades. We hope that the election is conducted freely, fairly and without violence.
