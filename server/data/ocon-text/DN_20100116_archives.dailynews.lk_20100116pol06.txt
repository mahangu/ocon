Telengu ethnic group supports President

There were approximately 150,000 people of the Telangu ethnic group in the country and we will vote for President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the forthcoming presidential election as he is the true national leader of the country, Sri Lanka Telengu Congress President M. Ambalavanar said yesterday.

Addressing a press conference at the Mahaveli Centre yesterday he said they supported President Rajapaksa unconditionally and without any agreement. One of the reasons for our decision to support the President was that NDF candidate Sarath Fonseka had made statement that the minorities had no place in this country. We think that it was not a very valuable statement.

On the other hand President Rajapaksa had ended the war and our children were able to go to school freely. They are learning Sinhala also but before peace was achieved people thought that everyone who speaks Tamil was a terrorist. Though we speak Tamil we are Telengu people who came to Sri Lanka about 150 years back.
