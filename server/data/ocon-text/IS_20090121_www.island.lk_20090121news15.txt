Galle Mayor Methsiri de Silva was compelled to postpone the Council sittings due to lack of quorum following several members boycotting the sittings. The boycott was sequel to permission not being granted for the former Mayor, who is also a Council member, to attend the sittings.

Following an order by the Galle District Court, the former Mayor was allowed to attend the sittings as a Council member on Friday but when he arrived for the last Council meeting he was prevented from entering the Council chambers by the security officials.

Following this, several Opposition members were seen in conversation with the former Mayor at the entrance to the chambers and around the same time the Mayor rang the quorum bell but the necessary numbers failed to turn up.
