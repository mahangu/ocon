US helps conserve Northern forests

US Ambassador to Sri Lanka Patricia A. Butenis officially presented mapping equipment and specialized software to assist the Forest Department with its conservation efforts in the North. Environment and Natural Resources Minister Patalee Champika Ranawaka, accepted on behalf of the Government.

The US Agency for International Development (USAID) provided computer equipment and specialised software to the Forest Department's Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing Unit for their mapping operations. USAID, the development agency of the US Government, will also provide three day technical training to Forest Department staff, led by USAID/Sri Lanka's expert GIS specialist.

US Ambassador Patricia A. Butenis said, "The US Government is pleased to partner with the Environment Ministry to increase the technical capacity of the Forest Department to manage Sri Lanka's valuable forest resources more effectively.

We share Sri Lanka's commitment to protecting the natural environment, and we applaud the Government of Sri Lanka for making conflict-affected areas a priority for conservation efforts.

I am especially pleased that this partnership involves a transfer of technical knowledge, as we have much to learn from each other." The Forest Department will use this new equipment to collect information and create maps of forest resources.

As a result of the conflict in Sri Lanka, the maps of forest resources in the North have not been updated for nearly 20 years.

The information gained through this partnership will help the Forest Department make sound forest management and conservation decisions for the future.
