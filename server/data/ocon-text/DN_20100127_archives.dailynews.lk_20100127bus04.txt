Sri Lanka Insurance recorded a 333 percent growth in life insurance proposals received on the January 1, 2010 when compared to last year, which is the highest number of proposals received by Sri Lanka Insurance in a single day. The public trust gained due to the corporation being re-instated in the state sector further strengthening the stability of the corporation and the magnanimous interim bonus of Rs three billion declared in December 2009 to life insurance policy holders, were significant causes for this excellent achievement.
