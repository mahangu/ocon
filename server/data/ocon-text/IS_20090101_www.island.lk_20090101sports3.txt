Karachi: Cricket authorities here have a fresh problem to deal with after Sri Lanka asked for a changed itinerary with lesser matches for their forthcoming tour of Pakistan.

A senior Pakistan Cricket Board official revealed that Sri Lanka had informed PCB that they would like to tour the country from February 15 for a series featuring two Tests, three ODIs and a T20 match.

Incidentally, the Sri Lankans had earlier agreed to play three Tests and five one-day internationals from January 20.

Tricky situation

"The situation is tricky now, because if we go by Sri Lanka's revised itinerary then this series clashes with our confirmed tour of Bangladesh scheduled from March 3," the official said.

Pakistan had invited Sri Lanka to play the series after India cancelled its scheduled tour following the Mumbai attacks.

PCB chief operating officer Saleem Altaf said he would be speaking to the Bangladesh Cricket Board to change dates for the series against Pakistan.

"We would now have to tour Bangladesh from mid-March, instead of March 3, if we are to host the Sri Lankans. I am hopeful the Bangladesh board will cooperate with us but it all depends on their FTP commitments," Altaf said.

Doubts lingered over Sri Lanka's tour to Pakistan as the Arjuna Ranatunga-led interim committee, which had okayed the series, was sacked last week. (PTI)
