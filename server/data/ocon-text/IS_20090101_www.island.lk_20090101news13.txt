Ceylon Teachers' Service Union has asked Education Minister Susil Premjayanth not to deny students who fail English at the GCE O/L examination an opportunity to enter A/L classes.

Mahinda Jayasinghe, General Secretary of the union told The Island that English had been categorised as a compulsory subject along with Sinha, Tamil, Literature, History and Science. Stressing the need for students to acquire competency in English, Jayasinghe asserted that it would be a tragedy if students were denied higher education on that basis.
