The Island-FeaturesJacob Young gave up his toy gun so he could see the Queen without creating any unnecessary anxieties for her bodyguards

A 12-year-old boy had to surrender his toy rifle to police amid tight security around the Queen's visit to church at Sandringham.

By Simon Johnson Jacob Young said he handed in the wooden weapon so he could see the Queen without giving her or her bodyguards any cause for concern.

He said: "When I got to the park gates I handed my gun to the policeman and he hung it on the fence.

"I didn't want anybody to think I wanted to shoot the Queen. I didn't mind handing in my gun. I knew it would be safe with the police."

Jacob, of March, Cambridgeshire, had been walking with his parents in nearby woods and was wearing a green beret, camouflage clothing and boots.

His father, John, 48, said: "We thought we would go and see the Queen, but I told Jacob he wouldn't be allowed to take his gun into the park.

"We could see they were very hot on security and thought there would be no funny looks or any problems if we just handed the gun in."

About 150 well-wishers braved the cold weather to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family yesterday. All were searched with a metal detector.

The Queen, wearing a matching peach coloured coat and hat trimmed with brown fur, drove from Sandringham House accompanied by the Countess of Wessex.

The Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Edward walked to church, a distance of about a quarter of a mile.

As Prince Edward walked through the crowd, who had stood for an hour in below-freezing conditions, he said: "You must be bonkers."

About 30 children presented the Queen with flowers after the service.
