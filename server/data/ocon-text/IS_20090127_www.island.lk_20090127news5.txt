Despite the Ministry of Power and Energy targeting 500 MW additional power by the year 2015 through Non Conventional Renewable Energy (NCRC) Sources the task seems is distant reality due to the lackadaisical attitude of some officials in important positions energy experts warn.

However, energy experts warn that due to a number of unreasonable deals and shortcomings of the CEB it would be difficult to stick to plans.According to Power and Energy Minister W D J Seneviratne, to date, nearly 144.392 MW of NCRE has been added to the system from 73 small scale projects. Another 41 small scale projects for generating of 104.45 MW of power was ready for commercial operation This was due to the signing of the Standardized Power Purchase Agreement with the CEB.

This purchase tariff will be multi tiered to cushion the high expense of a NCRE project the period of debt repayment and it would reflect a 22 per cent return on equity to the investor throughout the a 15-year period.
