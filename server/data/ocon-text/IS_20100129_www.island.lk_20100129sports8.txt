Mirpur: Magnanimous in victory against a side which is young in international cricket, star Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar patted the home side players for their good performance.

Tendulkar, who was presented a memento by the series sponsors for becoming the only batsman to have scored 13,000 Test runs, went to the home side dressing room after the presentation ceremony in company of their assistant coach Khalid Mahmud.

Tendulkar told the Bangladesh players that except for the batting collapse in their second innings on Wednesday, they played well in the three innings and should keep on improving with experience.

Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan, on his part, said at the post-match press conference that the players were delighted to have words of praise from a star player like Tendulkar.

"We are an improving side. Even a star player like Tendulkar said we are improving and will learn with experience,"he said. (PTI)
