Special Task Force operations found an explosive-strapped jacket hidden in an abandoned land near the Dehiwela bridge, Police said. A labourer engaged in cleaning the land whose owners are domiciled in Australia had informed the Forces, after he became suspicious that something had been buried in the abandoned land. Police believe the bag containing the explosives could have been buried a few weeks ago. Dehiwela Police are investigating.
