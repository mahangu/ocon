Van Moppes continues sympathy for Asian women

Tall and vivacious, the French writer Catherine van Moppes, is of Russian and Dutch origin. With her long dark hair and oriental features, she is often mistaken for an Indian from the North of the subcontinent. Catherine's life and work revolve between Europe and Asia.

She has just published a novel which takes place in France and in the Dutch East Indies. From her outward appearance, this passionate lady could also be mistaken for an 'Indo' girl in the Dutch East Indies, like the heroine in her novel: "Since I was very young, not only did I look different, I always felt different from the average French girl. I also lived in a world of books and wrote stories on my own since I was little!"

Van Moppes never really knew her Dutch father and grew up surrounded by her Russian family in Paris. Her mother's family originated from around Tashkent which once belonged to the Southernmost part of the Soviet Union.

Driven by her early propensity to write, she continued, while still at school, by working for legendary artist Henri Langlois who headed the Francaise' - with its collection of milestone films in Paris - and his wife Mary Meerson, a writer.

As a teenager her ambition was to become a script writer. Catherine soon began writing experimental scenarios nurtured by encounters with film greats Orson Welles, Bunuel, Kurosawa and many others.
