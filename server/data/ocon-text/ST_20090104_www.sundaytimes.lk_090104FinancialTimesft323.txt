Ceylinco Shriram is regulated by CBCeylinco Shriram Securities Ltd said this week it has no involvement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is a company that is a licensed Primary Dealer under the Central Bank.

 It was referring to last week's report in The Sunday Times FT headlined " Golden Key: System and investors to blame" where it was stated that '...the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had called a meeting with Ceylinco Shriram Securities on Friday to discuss the possible fallout from the Golden Key and Seylan Bank problems.' The company says the newspaper report is misleading.

The error is regretted. The company we were referring to should have been Ceylinco Shriram Asset Management.
