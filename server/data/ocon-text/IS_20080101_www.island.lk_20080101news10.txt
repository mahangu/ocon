"Prisoners are also human" Time to ease congestion in Prisons â€“ Ex-chief

by Franklin R. Satyapalan

Former Commissioner General Of Prisons H. G. Dharmadasa said that it was high time that the Government took meaningful steps to ease congestion in the Prisons.

He made these comments when questioned on the repeated complaints of prisoners that "they were treated worse than cattle, shackled like slaves and transported to courts with barely a room to breathe, whereas the Law allows only 24 head of cattle to be transported in a lorry, although in bold letters on the prison walls it was stated, for all to see, 'Prisoners are also Humans'.

He was speaking at the 15th AGM of the Asian Crime Prevention Foundation (ACPF) held at the Galle Face Hotel. Attorney General C. R. De Silva made the keynote address as the chief Guest.

The present situation was beyond the control of the Prison Authorities who were doing their utmost to make ends meet with little what was available, Dharmadasa said.

At the moment there are over 200 people who have been sentenced to death and according to the prison rules only one person can be kept in a cell but at present there are only two prisons Welikade and Bogambara where condemned prisoners can be kept and there are more than five to a cell.

Further, for the last two and a half years death sentences have not been commuted to life imprisonment, he said.
