The Cuban Embassy in Sri Lanka will conduct a film festival to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of its revolution. The festival commences on Monday (12) at 4.30 p.m.

Briefing the press at the Cuban Embassy yesterday (09), Cuban Ambassador Nirsia Castro Guevara, said the film festival would be conducted also to mark the Cuban National Day which was celebrated on the first of January.

The films that are to be screened are: Fidel (12), Benny More (13), The Revolution (14), Viva Cuba (15), Scent of Oak (16) and Che Guevara (17). The films will be screened at the Russian Centre and admission will be free.

The festival will be conducted by the Cuban Embassy in collaboration with the Cuban Friendship Society.

Secretary and Information Officer, Wilfred Jayasinghe said "There were many Sri Lankan students studying in Cuba. There are Sri Lankan doctors who have Cuban medical degrees," the Secretary said. Moreover Sri Lankans show a great deal of interest in watching Cuban films â€“ the only problem being that they don't have the opportunity to do so as Cuban films are hard to come by.
