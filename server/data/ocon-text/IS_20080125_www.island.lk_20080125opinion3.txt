I firmly believe that a lasting solution to the above crisis can be found by following method that satisfies the needs of the all the stake holders.

The president should invite about 10 reputed local companies, having strong, respected product brands, which however do not produce rice, and request them to buy and hold buffer stocks of parboiled rice of very good quality during the coming 2 months. For this purpose these companies can be provided with storage, and financial facilities etc., if they so desire. They may be asked to buy Nadu and Samba rice at Rs. 40/- and 45- respectively. Rice being purchased at this price will help the price of paddy to remain stable, hovering around Rs. 20/-, at the time of harvesting. It should be noted that parboiled rice at correct dryness, could last more than a year or so in storage. These stocks can be released to the open market through selected sales outlets in time of shortages-an occurrence seen often several weeks before harvesting begins - perhaps with an added value of Rs. 10/=. Raw rice is not to be stored as it will not last long. Even in the rare case of prices not reaching the desired levels for the stocks to be released to the market, the government can intervene and divert them for the consumption of the security forces or Samurdhi recipients, thereby reducing the risk factor likely to be considered by the prospective firms.

The government should not burn its fingers by venturing in to setting up rice mills or trying to purchase paddy or rice. This has failed and it will fail again.

His Excellency must make it clear to these companies the importance of this national endeavour. Their role is not only to make profits, but also to contribute to a project of national importance.
