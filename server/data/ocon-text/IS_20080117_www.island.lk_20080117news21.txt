Panic reigned as the Bandaranaike International Airport was placed on high alert yesterday following a bomb scare which later turned out to be a hoax.

An unruly Sri Lankan passenger had informed the crew of the Katunayake bound Eurofly flight EJ -21 from Italy that he was wearing a suicide bomb jacket.

The Airport was placed on high alert and air traffic controllers, Air Force and Special Force commandos were rushed to the airport to receive the 'suicide bomber.'

Fire engines and ambulances had been lined up in the vicinity of the tarmac. After the successful emergency landing the commandos and airmen tackled the suspected 'suicide bomber' and a subsequent body search found that his threat was a hoax, officials said.

The youth had admitted to security officials that he had lied. He was handed over to the Katunayake Police. "He had been employed in Italy. He would be produced before a psychiatrist to check whether he was suffering from any mental illness, officials said.

Negombo SSP Premasiri Vitana told The Island that the youth would be produced before Courts for providing false information.

Further investigations are being conducted under instructions of Airport OIC Eric Perera.
