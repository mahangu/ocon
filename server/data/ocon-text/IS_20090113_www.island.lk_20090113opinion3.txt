Mr. 'Kattadiya' writing to 'The Island' of 6/1 has expressed his genuine surprise when he received a New Year greeting card with the figures of two devils wishing him well and invoking all devils to save him from all evil.

Mr. 'Kattadiya' asks: 'Don't we believe that the devil brings all evil?' He adds: 'If so, is it correct to appeal to the devil to save us from evil and disasters?'

Both Christians and Buddhists believe in devils. The devil is the biggest enemy of God and ever since the devil was created by the Almighty it has been the creator's biggest headache. Adam did not observe that the form of the human female, unlike her mind and spirit, is the most challenging loveliness in all God's creations until the devil, in the form of a serpent pointed to Eval. But when Adam tasted the forbidden fruit, God got very angry and all of us are born sinners as a result - whatever the logic of it is! I am not conversant with Muslim thinking on this subject and perhaps some Moulawi will explain.

Buddhists' belief in devils is proved by the Aataanatiya Sutra chanted by Buddhist monks with maximum noise and even firecrackers to frighten the devils. In areas where loudspeakers are available the volume is set to maximum! If not for the Supreme Court order to stop noise pollution after 10 p.m. we would have still heard this Sutra, especially at midnight, because that is said to be the hour at which the devil is most powerful.
