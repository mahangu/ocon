Intercom brand cinnamon commands a premium status in the world of spices and has the distinction of being known for maintaining genuine high quality in products for over 50 years.

In spite of the many challenges faced over its fifty year history Intercom has taken a gigantic leap forward by achieving ISO-9001-2000, ISO 22000-2005 and HACCP Certification meeting all food safety standards. Intercom is probably only the first cinnamon export company to obtain these three certifications in Sri Lanka.

Muttukumaraswamy and Owen Kreltszheim who were pioneers in the cinnamon and coconut industry, Intercom established itself as one of the leading exporters of Cinnamon to world markets, with the catch phrase "Quality is Our Strength" bringing them recognition as the number one exporter of quality cinnamon.

With unmatched quality to this day, 'Intercom' brand cinnamon has become a household name throughout the Central and South American regions.
