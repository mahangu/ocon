St Peter's coast to fifth outright winVinod Perera of St. Peter's in action, yesterday. ( Pic by Ranjith Perera) St Peter's coasted to their fifth outright win of the Under 19 inter-school cricket season when they recorded a comprehensive ten wicket win over St Sebastian's in the match concluded at Bambalapitiya yesterday. 

 It were the right arm medium fast bowlers Vinod Perera and Nilochana Perera who laid the foundation for their win when the duo broke the backbone of the Sebs batting in the first innings when play commenced in the morning session yesterday. 



 Vinod returned impressive figures of 5 for 21 while his partner Nilochana ended with figures of 4 for 19 to bundle out the visitors for just 113 from a strong position of 80 for 3. This was after Chathura Peiris and skipper Angelo Perera helped the home side post a challenging 282 on day one.



 Sebs made to follow on with a deficit of 169 runs again lost wickets at regular intervals and were badly placed on 122 for 5 at lunch. But a valiant effort put in by Deshan Dias who made a solid 83 was in vain as his dismissal saw them lose their last three wickets cheaply with left arm paceman and Sri Lankan youth player Chathura Peiris doing the damage taking 6 for 33.



 This left the home team a simple target of 26 which they achieved with the minimum of fuss. Incidentally the Petes are defeating their opponents after a lapse of 25 years with the last win being recorded in the year 1983.



 St Peter's 282 (Chathura Peiris 65, Angelo Perera 46, Shivanga Ranasuriya 31, Nilochana Perera 29, Vinod Perera 38 n.o.: Amila Aponso 5 for 117) and 27 for no loss in 2.1 overs (Angelo Emmanuel 14 n.o.)

 St Sebastian's (80/3 cont.) 113 in 35 overs (Deshan Dias 33, Prageeth Dilshan 27: Viond Perera 5 for 21, Nilochana Perera 4 for 19) and 194 in 64overs (Deshan Dias 83, Kasun Fernando 28, Samith de Mel 21: Chathura Peiris 6 for 33)
