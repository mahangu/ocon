SriLankan Holidays is offering holidaymakers a chance to experience one of the most exciting seasons in the United Arab Emirates as the much sought-after Dubai Shopping Festival takes the stage in January.

Spread over 32 days from January 24 to February 24, visitors to the Dubai Shopping Festival will be treated to the best shopping deals and the widest range of entertainment for the entire family.

Dubai is know for its shopping opportunities throughout the year, but the city really lays out the red carpet during shopping festival month, with over 2,300 retails outlets participating, that offer everything from the leading fashion labels in clothes and accessories to electronics, finely crafted jewellery, perfume and handicrafts.

The city's diversity means that visitors can enjoy a whole range of different experiences in addition to the shopping from riding the beautiful undulating desert sands to the bustling downtown areas, theme parks and recreational sports complexes.

An unending array of activities are available for the adventurous, including formula racing at the Dubai Autodrome, skiing at Skii Dubai, getting wet at Wild Wadi and partying till dawn at the many exclusive nightspots in Dubai.

For a more soulful experience, Dubai tones it down with a cruise down the legendary Creek on a traditional Dhow, with dinner and a laid back view of old and new Dubai blending seamlessly.

Other options to discover Dubai is through its museums, historic sites and a trip to Deira or the old city and the gold and spice souks.

"Bargains are at its best at the Dubai Shopping Festival and getting there early is the secret to a great shopping experience," General Manager, SriLankan Holidays Amith Sumanapala said.

"Dubai comes alive for the shopping festival including all the theme parks and other entertainment venues also playing their part to make the event exciting and memorable."
