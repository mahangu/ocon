The Consumer Affairs Ministry yesterday vested powers in the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) to take legal action against any person hoarding rice, trying to control the price of rice or selling rice at black market prices.

Consumer Affairs Minister Bandula Gunawardane said the decision was taken after rice was declared an essential commodity with effect from Wednesday.

Ministry sources said that certain elements, who were bent on destabilising the government, were buying rice from the farmers at a very low price and hoarding it to create an artificial scarcity in order to sell it at a higher price later.

"As a result a kilo of rice has gone up to Rs 100 in the market," the sources said.

Meanwhile, the JVP accused a powerful Cabinet Minister and a Deputy Minister from the Polonnaruwa district, who own rice mills in the district of operating a rice cartel that is controlling the rice market in the entire country.

The JVP said it was these politicians, turned rice mill owners, who buy the rice from the farmers for a paltry price, stock it and create an artificial scarcity to sell it at an exorbitant price later. The politicians involved in this racket have to be brought to book, before punishing others, it said.
