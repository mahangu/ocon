Sun and Zimonjic down India's Mirza and Bhupathi for mixed doubles title

MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) - China's Sun Tiantian and Nenad Zimonjic of Serbia won the Australian Open mixed doubles title Sunday with a 7-6 (4) 6-4 victory over Indian pair Sania Mirza and Mahesh Bhupathi.

Fifth-seeded Sun and Zimonjic started with an early break on Rod Laver Arena, but the Indian team broke serve soon after, forcing the eventual tiebreaker.

Sun and Zimonjic continued their momentum by breaking Bhupathi in his opening service game.

The Indians saved three match points on Bhupathi's serve in the ninth game, before Zimonjic served out to secure the title.

"I thought we started really well. I don't think I missed one ball before maybe third or fourth game, which I think helped Tiantian a little bit because it was her first (Grand Slam) finals," Zimonjic said.

Sun, who won the 2004 women's doubles Olympic gold medal with Li Ting, said she could not rate one title against the other.

"It's hard to compare Grand Slams and Olympics because in China we pay much attention to the Olympics, but the rest of the world pays more attention to Grand Slams," she said. "There is fierce competition in Grand Slams, which gives me better preparation for the Olympic Games."

Sun is expected to team with Athens doubles partner Li for the Beijing Olympic tournament in August.

It was Zimonjic's second Australian Open mixed doubles title after winning in 2004 with Elena Bovina.

Mirza, who lost to Venus Williams in the third round of the singles, has now replaced China's Li Na as Asia's top-ranked women's singles player at No. 29.

"I'm very happy, I think this is the first time I've been Asian No. 1, so it's an honor," she said.

On Saturday, Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram became the first Israeli pairing to win a Grand Slam title when they outlasted Frenchmen Michael Llodra and Arnaud Clement in the men's doubles.
