The Island-NewsThe Southern Province Excise Special Operations Bureau last week raided six illicit distilleries operated in the islets of the Madu Ganga and arrested four suspects during the festive season.

Excise Inspector M. Jayantha De Silva, Spokesman for the Bureau, said the six 'Moonshine' distilleries were being operated in the islets of Pathamulla, Ovilana and Mahaladuwa for some time.

The suspects were released on Rs 50,000 Excise bail each.

"The illicit brewers had submerged Goda barrels in the water, tied to the 'Ja-Kotu' (wooden cages used to catch prawns), in the river to avoid detection.

Acting on a tip off received by Commissioner General of Excise Wasantha Hapuarachchi, a team of officers from the Southern Special Operations Bureau reached the islets swimming across the river and wading through the water," De Silva said.

Releasing Goda into the river had resulted in diminishing the prawn population he added.

The Moonshine produced at those distilleries had been distributed to bootleggers in the Balapitiya, Ahungalle and Ambalangoda areas.

Among the items seized were 25 barrels of Goda, 20,250 Mls of Kasippu spirit, 4,050 litres of Goda and six copper coils.

The raid was conducted by a team officers led by OIC Southern Province Special Excise Operations Bureau Dheera Gunasekera with Excise Inspectors M. Jayantha De Silva, T. L.P. Mendis, Excise Guards Viraj Hemapala, K. W. K. Jayakody, Sisira Kumara and Asanka Kalyanapriya, under the supervision of Excise Superintendent Galle H. W. D. Kulatunge under the direction of Southern Province Excise Asst. Commissioner B. A. Dayaratne.
