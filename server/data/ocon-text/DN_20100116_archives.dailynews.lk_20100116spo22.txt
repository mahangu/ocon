Flintoff to miss IPL as he targets county honours

Andrew Flintoff will not fulfil the second year of his contract with Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise the Chennai Super Kings after undergoing another operation on his right knee.

However, the England all-rounder has set his sights on playing for his native county side Lancashire in all competitions in the next English season, having believed he would be fit for one-day matches only, even if he won't be returning until midway through the domestic campaign.

Pace bowler and hard-hitting batsman Flintoff retired from Test cricket after helping England regain the Ashes last year, saying his injury-hit body could no longer stand the strain, but stressed he wanted to remain involved in the one-day set-up.

However, he has not played at all since undergoing a micro-fracture operation on his right knee soon after the Ashes. But, following what a statement released Thursday by his agent said was a "routine arthroscopy operation" this week to check on his knee, which is expected to sideline him for six months, Flintoff altered his ambitions.

"My goals have changed since last summer," Flintoff said. ``I trust the surgeon, Andy Williams, implicitly and he is very pleased with the progress of the operation.

"When I first had the operation I did not think I would be able to play anything other than one-day cricket, but the news of my recovery has led me to believe I may play in all forms of cricket for Lancashire." "My first love remains playing for Lancashire and I want to help them win trophies and hopefully I can help achieve that later this (English) summer."

The statement added Flintoff's decision to undergo another operation took into account he would not be able to fulfil the second year of his contract with Chennai in the IPL. LONDON, Friday, AFP
