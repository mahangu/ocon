We are gathering here at the moment the glad tidings reach our ears of the success by our heeroic soldiers capturing the Mullaitivu town. Muslims too rejoice in this historic fete and join all other communities in showering tributes to President Mahinda Rajapaksa and our brave security forces for achieving what whole world believes as a great military success.

This was stated by A. H. M. Azwer, President Advisor and Former Minister of Muslim Affairs, at the Sixth anniversary of the Hambantota Muhammdiya Association held at Zahira College, Colombo last Sunday.

Azwer said that, Zahira College had played a significant role in the past. It was Dr. T. B. Jayah, a great national leader who instilled in the minds of Muslims a great sense of patriotism during the struggle for independence from the British Raj. His clarion call to the Muslim country to contribute their share to free the country of Colonialism. As a result the Muslims whole heartedly threw there lot with the Sinhalese and Tamils communities to achieve independence.

This was the guiding principal set by Dr. Jayah for generations of Muslim to follow. During every national crisis that may beset the country. The Muslim therefore today should rally round President Mahinda Rajapaksa helping him to usher an undivided Sri Lanka for us to live in peace and harmony.
