No democracy in UNP - Johnston

Lakshmi de Silva

Opposition and UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe was hiding behind the Parliamentary privileges and had alleged Sarath Fonseka's hit squads killed the Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickremetunga. It was recorded in the Hansard. He was the first person to speak at that debate but now he talks about media freedom, said Land Development and Janavasa and Ranaviru Welfare Minister Johnston Fernando addressing a recent UPFA press conference.

"My only ambition is to defeat New Democratic Front candidate Sarath Fonseka and ensure the victory of President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the President for a second term of office", he said.

"I consulted the people who voted for me before joining the Government of President Mahinda Rajapaksa and I have a very large voter base in my district. I still love my party the UNP", Minister Johnston Fernando said.

There is no democracy in the party and 40 Members of Parliament from our party joined the UPFA. Even strong members like former UNP Minister Imtiyaz Bakeer Markar kept away from politics and I too thought of doing so but I could not betray the people who supported me", he explained.

"On January 26, UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe and his wife would not vote for the New Democratic Front candidate Sarath Fonseka. Ranil Wickremesinghe had destroyed the UNP and ruined the elephant symbol too", he noted.
