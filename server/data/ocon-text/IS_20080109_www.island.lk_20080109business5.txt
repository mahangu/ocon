Unilever optimistic toiletries will hold their ownby Jayantha de Silva

Unilever Sri Lanka Ltd. is optimistic that competition from imported natural product-based beauty culture soap brands, especially in the popular fruit range, would not tilt the scales against them.

This is attributed to the corporate giant's decades of market presence which had spawned products such as Lux and the flagship Sunlight to become virtually household brand names. Also natural products as King Coconut shampoo are offering stiff competition to imported brand presence in the toiletries products market.

In an interview with The Island Financial Review, Ramani Samarasundera, Marketing Director and Charmila Hettiarachi, Corporate Relations Manager, stressed that unlike the imported toiletries, Unilever products have achieved 90 per cent distribution coverage reaching out to the rural community even in remote areas such as Dehiattekandiya and also in strife-torn Jaffna.

Signal tooth paste and the Lifebuoy range in handy shampo sachets have about 50-60 per cent of the market share due to customer recognition of the products lower price factor, said the Marketing Director. Pear's brand talcum powder, a sterilized baby care product, is also a sought- after brand, she added.

Furthermore, Dove, an imported brand from Thailand which acts both as a shampoo and a conditioner, is popular with the upmarket segment, said the Corporate Relations Manager.

The corporate entity has maintained a growth rate of rate of 14 per cent last year (2007) and looks forward to introduce a range of products to meet customer aspirations in the new year.
