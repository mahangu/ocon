LONDON (AP) - Former England captain Michael Corry retired from international rugby on Tuesday.

The 34-year-old Leicester flanker has told coach Brian Ashton not to include him when announcing his squad for the Six Nations next week, ending an international career that brought him 64 appearances, two British and Irish Lions tours, and a starting berth in last year's World Cup final defeat to South Africa.

"From a purely selfish point of view, I am really disappointed that Martin Corry will no longer be featuring in a white shirt," Ashton said. "I know, as many others do, that he has worn it with pride and dignity for many years."

Corry made his England debut in 1997 in Argentina, but soon struggled to get past the established back row trio of Richard Hill, Neil Back and Lawrence Dallaglio for a regular starting spot.

Often used as a replacement in the latter stages, he was a peripheral member of the squad that won the 2003 World Cup. He only became a regular after that tournament, being named captain in 2005.

His tenure as captain coincided with the retirement and loss to injury of many key players, resulting in a run of eight losses in nine games, and he was replaced by Phil Vickery in 2007 after Ashton succeeded Andy Robinson.

Ashton kept him in his starting lineup, often at lock, with his final appearance coming in October's 15-6 World Cup final defeat to South Africa.

"He has been an outstanding member of the England rugby team both on and off the field over a long period of time and his contribution will be sorely missed," Ashton said. "Martin has captained England on a number of occasions, often in difficult circumstances, and he has always led the side from the front in his own inimitable fashion."
