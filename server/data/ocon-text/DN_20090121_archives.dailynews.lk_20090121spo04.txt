Chinese stars shine bright for Asia

Chinese stars Zheng Jie and Peng Shuai shone brightly for Asia at the Australian Open on Tuesday, but regional hopes were dented as Japan's Kei Nishikori and Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn slumped out.

The talented Zheng is shaping as one of Asia's best hopes here with fellow Chinese star Li Na missing the tournament through injury.

"It was tough out there, hot and windy, so it wasn't comfortable but it was a good win," said Zheng after easing past Frenchwoman Camille Pin 6-3, 6-3.

Along with Peng, she joins Japan's Ai Sugiyama, India's Sania Mirza and Taiwan's Lu Yen-Hsun in the next round.

Also through is Chan Yung-jan, who won an all-Taiwanese battle against Hsieh Su-Wei 6-3, 6-3.

But Japan's Ayumi Morita was a first-round casualty, capitulating to Germany's Tatjana Malek 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 as she joined Nishikori and Tamarine on an early plane home.

For Zheng, last year's Wimbledon semi-finalist, getting through the opening round here was something of a novelty having crashed at the first hurdle on each of her four previous appearances. But after a solid 2008 that saw her soar through the rankings to her current 24, she is a more composed player.

"I'm very happy because it is the first time I have gone past the first round here," said the 22nd seed.

"Making the semi-finals at Wimbledon last year gave me a lot of confidence in how to play in Grand Slams.
