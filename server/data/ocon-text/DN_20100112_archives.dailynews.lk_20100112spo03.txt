A captain's knock of 41 not out with six fours and two sixes made under trying conditions helped Kandy District XI to score a thrilling three-wicket win over ICC Associate Champions Afghanistan in a limited over cricket match played at the Pallekele Cricket Stadium in Pallekele yesterday.

Though Kandy District won they were made to fight all the way by the Afghans who bowled and fielded well after their front-line batsmen failed. Kandy District won the toss and invited Afghanistan to bat.

The visitors included six players from their Development Squad while the balance six were national players who played for them in the ICC Trophy tournament matches and this included their star pace bowler Hasti Gul Abed.

Taking first strike Afghans ran into problems against the pace of Madhushan Bototage who extracted a lot of life from the pitch to end up with figures of 3 for 19. The visitors were at one time 47 for 4 which became later 78 for 6.

Shamiullah Shinwani (22) and Shafiqullah Shafaq (13) batting well down the line helped them to pass the century mark before they were all out 123 in 34.1 overs. Apart from Madhushan Bototage, spinners Kasun Ekanayake 2 for 17 and Nadun Basnayake 2 for 12 bowled well.

Medium pacer Hasti Gul Abed bowled extremely well to end up with figures of 4 for 37.
