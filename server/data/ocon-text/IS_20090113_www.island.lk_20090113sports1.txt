An unbeaten half-century from 21-year-old Angelo Mathews (52 not out) then rescued Sri Lanka from a humiliating scoreline.

Opener Upul Tharanga (42) provided some stability to the Sri Lanka innings and added 51 runs in quick time for the opening wicket with left-hander Sanath Jayasuriya (22).

Jayasuriya, however, was caught off Elton Chigumbura and Rainsford, whose first spell of three overs cost 18 runs, returned to wreck havoc.

Mathews resurrected Sri Lanka's innings and added 69 for the sixth wicket with Jehan Mubarak (31) before a late flourish of 28 from just 27 deliveries from Thilan Thushara helped Sri Lanka cross the 200-run mark.

Sri Lanka's next match in the series will be against tournament hosts Bangladesh in Mirpur on Wednesday. (Cricket365.com)
