ICRC and UN finally bring patients to Vavuniya

Two hundred and twenty six patients in the company of their 139 relatives and bystanders were picked from Puthukkudiyiruppu and brought down to Vavuniya by officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and UN yesterday evening.

Twelve ambulances and five buses with Medical Officers and nursing staff, attached to Vavuniya hospital received them from the troops at the Forward Defence Line (FDL) in the south of Puthuk-kudiyiruppu after they were escorted to the FDL by ICRC from un-cleared areas. At least 40 children are among the civilians brought to Vavuniya.

Tiger terrorists holding some 300 patients as captives to be used as their 'human shields' earlier refused permission for them to enter cleared areas despite appeals by UN and ICRC.

Twelve ambulances and five buses sent from Vavuniya by the Government returned empty-handed after waiting for more than five hours.

Troops between Vavuniya and the south of Puthukkudiyiruppu provided protection and unhindered movement to the convoy that reached Vavuniya late yesterday evening. Both UN staffers held hostage by the LTTE found their way out with the same group.
