Officials of the Power and Energy Ministry and the Ceylon Electricity Board yesterday expressed concern over two aspects of plans to ease the country out of its looming energy crisis. One was the staggering allocation being made to foreign consultants from the recently approved technical assistance given by the Asian Development Bank.

The other issue is the delay in implementing the long-term plan for increasing power generation which is expected to create a shortage of about 400 megawatts (MW) in 2008 and reduce the reserve margin from 9.5 per cent in 2007 to only two per cent in 2008, officials said.

As demand for power is growing at about eight per cent per year, further delay will extend power shortages beyond 2008 and create significant impediments to economic growth.

The Island learns that the total cost of technical assistance is USD 750,000. The Government has requested the ADB to finance USD 600,000 and the Government will fork out the balance USD 150,000. However, USD 250,000 has been allocated as fees for foreign consultants.

USD 600,000 will be financed as a grant by the Clean Energy Fund contributed by the Australian and Norwegian Governments under the clean energy financing partnership facility administrated by the ADB.

Government financing will go to meet office accommodation and transport USD 40,000, remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff USD 70,000, others USD 25,000 and contingencies.

Recently the Government requested assistance from the ADB for capacity building. The concept paper for advisory technical assistance was approved in October for the ADB's 2007 TA program for Sri Lanka.

According to Ministry sources fact finding mission visited Sri Lanka from October 29 to November 2 and reached an understanding with the government on the objective, scope, cost estimates, counterpart funding and implementation arrangements of the TA.

Presently, the TA is focusing on strengthening staff capacity in the Sustainable Energy Authority to promote private sector investment in renewable energy projects and develop policy and develop policy and financial instruments for them.
