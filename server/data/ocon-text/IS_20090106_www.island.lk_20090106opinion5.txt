The Island-OpinionWhen Al Jazeera first appeared on TV screens I was happy to see an intelligent Third World antidote to the grossly Western stance of the BBC and CNN. But, to my great disappointment, it hardly differs from both these channels when it comes to reporting on our battles with the Tigers. A couple of days ago, when reporting on the fall of Kilinochchi, the members of the public it saw fit to interview were those hardy perennials of the NGO bandwagon - Pakiasothy Saravanamuttu and Jehan Perera, who expressed their customary platitudes [re political solution, human rights etc] and badmouthed the government. No attempt was made to harness an articulate [and not English-challenged !] spokesman to put forward the government's viewpoint.
