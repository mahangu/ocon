Released LTTE cadres properly rehabilitated - Major General Daya Ratnayake

Commissioner General of Rehabilitation Major General Daya Ratnayake said all LTTE cadres who were released recently were either forcibly recruited to the movement or had little connection with the outfit.

The Government released 712 former LTTE cadres after rehabilitation on Saturday at Manik Farm in Vavuniya and they included 492 males and 220 females while there were 145 child soldiers, Ratnayake said. These former LTTE cadres were rehabilitated in 14 camps in Vavuniya before they were allowed to rejoin their families on Saturday, he added.
