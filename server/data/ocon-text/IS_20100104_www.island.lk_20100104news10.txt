Chennai (ANI) : A Tamil feature film got itself registered in the Guinness Book of World Records after it was completed in less than 12 days. Shooting and post-production of the two-hour film 'Shivappu Mazhai', was completed in a record 11 days, 23 hours and 45 minutes.

Describing the work as a big achievement film director V. Krishnamurthy said: "Shivappu Mazhai', a Tamil film, has been shot in 11 days 23 hours and 45 minutes. We have made a record. Prior to this, a British production company held the record, which was when they shot a film in 13 days in 1990. This took 12 days only."

Earlier, the record was held by 'The Fastest Forward', which was made by Russ Malkin and John Gore, in just 13 days in 1990. More than 600 technicians worked round the clock for making the film, which started in May 22 and was completed by June 3, 2009. Krishnamoorthy also said that the film is based on Sri Lankan Tamils.

"The film is based on Sri Lanka. The hero of the film, a doctor, works at a refugee service camp. He does not support any movement; he is offering his services to the war victims. His wife, who is also involved in the service, becomes a violence victim herself. This is out and out, a Sri Lankan Tamil's story," he said.
