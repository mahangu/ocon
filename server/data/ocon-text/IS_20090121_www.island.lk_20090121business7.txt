Having taken a full round tour and an additional week in an Ayurvedic hotel Marcel Vissers, chief editor of Meetings Industry Magazine (MIM) and Head Quarters Magazine (HQ), assured his two hosts Sri Lanka Convention Bureau and SriLankan Airlines that he will share his experience with his readers through several features in his two magazines.

The award winning publishser visited Sri lanka for the first time with his photographer Ronald Van Der Hilst, and stayed from December 29th to January 16th. The Bureau was very keen to have this visit realised with Vissiers reputation globally as a leading Personality in the Meetings Industry

Bureau's GM Vipula Wanigasekera, while thanking Sri Lankan airlines for supporting this visit, says that his visit will give a boost to Incentive travel from Europe as such personality endorsements on destinations and venues go a long way in changing perceptions.
