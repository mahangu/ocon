Following the expansion of 18-19 per cent in the two preceding months, earnings from exports contracted by 5.1 per cent in November 2007, year-on-year, to US dollars 591 million. This decline in export earnings could be attributed to a contraction in earnings from key industrial exports including garments and textiles, rubber products, and diamonds and jewellery. Industrial exports declined by 13.8 per cent with garments and textiles, which constituted 40 per cent of the total exports, declining by 12.9 per cent. Agricultural exports however, recorded a growth of 21.6 per cent, benefiting mainly from steadied earnings from tea. Despite the lower volume of exports, the strong demand from CIS and Middle Eastern countries raised the earnings from tea, with the highest ever price for tea being recorded in November 2007. The cumulative export earnings during the period January-November 2007 grew by 11.3 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 6,877 million.

The expenditure on imports increased by 15.4 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 1,010 million, as a result of the expenditure on import of investment goods and intermediate goods increasing further. International oil prices, which hit a record above US dollars 95 a barrel, was a major contributor to higher intermediate imports. Amongst other intermediate goods in relation to which import expenditure increased were textiles and clothing and diamonds. Amongst investment goods, import of machinery and equipment and building materials further increased, reflecting the growth momentum in the economy. The expenditure on consumer goods, however, declined by 15.9 per cent in November 2007 as a result of lower import of sugar and motor vehicles, while wheat was not imported. The cumulative expenditure on imports recorded an increase of 8.1 per cent, year-on-year, by end November 2007, and amounted to US dollars 10,142 million.

The trade deficit for November 2007 was US dollars 419 million, which is higher than that recorded for November 2006. The cumulative deficit in the trade balance for the period January-November 2007 recorded a marginal increase of 1.8 per cent in comparison to the corresponding period last year, and was US dollars 3,265 million. Meanwhile, private remittances during the period January-November 2007, however, amounted to US dollars 2,285 million, which is an increase of 15.1 per cent, year-on-year, thus helping to contain the deficit in the current account. By end-November 2007, the overall balance of payments registered a surplus of US dollars 616 million, and the gross official reserves totaled US dollars 3,149 million (3.4 months of imports). The external trade performance is further illustrated in the above table.
