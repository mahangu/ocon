About 550 university teachers haven't returned after the completion of their post graduate studies and training overseas, Chairman of the University Grants Commission, Prof. Gamini Samaranayake told The Island yesterday.

As they hadn't settled their dues in keeping with the bonds they entered into with the state, the UGC had no alternative but to make the guarantors concerned pay for the breach, Prof Samaranayake said.
