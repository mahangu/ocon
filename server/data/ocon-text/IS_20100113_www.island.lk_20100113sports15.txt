Mirpur: The winning momentum back after three successive wins, India would seek to maintain their supremacy over Sri Lanka and start the season on a positive note when they take on the islanders in the final of the tri-series on Wednesday.

Indian opener Virender Sehwag is most likely to play in the final of the tri-series against Sri Lanka in Mirpur on Wednesday.

The Indian vice-captain had missed the last two one-dayers reportedly due to an upset stomach.

Sehwag did not attend Saturday's practice session nor did he accompany his team-mates to the stadium on both days, raising concern about his fitness.

But team manager Arshad Ayub confirmed that Sehwag was fit and would play the final game.

"A lot has been made out of Sehwag. He is all well and fine without any injury and illness. Hopefully he will be back in the playing XI in the final," he said.
