Development next goal

As promised I delivered a free and united country.An environment has now been created to build on this victory and pass its dividends to the people.

As you supported me to eradicate terrorism support me to fulfill this endeavour as well, President Mahinda Rajapaksa said addressing a mammoth crowd at an election rally in Kalutara on Saturday.

He noted that he had come before the people after fulfilling the promise of uniting the country, with two more years remaining in his term and his future goal was to propel Sri Lanka as one of the most developed nations.

President Rajapaksa also emphasized that ensuring victory for the betel leaf symbol meant not only a personal/party victory but a triumph for the future generation as well.

While stressing that the Government was working on a new formula to pool all resources to develop the nation, the President said this new outlook towards development could solve the country's unemployment problem.

"We hope to provide more than 200,000 youth with viable foreign employment opportunities within this year.

"Plans have also been mooted to initiate housing projects for public servants," the President told the cheering crowd outlining some of the people friendly development efforts in the offing.

The President added that the Beruwela harbour too was being upgraded to help local fishermen.

Agriculture including rubber cultivation too has been given support.

In addition, plans are afoot to develop tourism related industries and attract more tourists. A new investment zone in Kalutara too is in the offing, which would create viable employment/business opportunities in the area, he added.

President Rajapaksa said more foreign direct investments will also be experienced in the country in the coming months.

President Rajapaksa said: "Let's unite to build a better future for our children".
