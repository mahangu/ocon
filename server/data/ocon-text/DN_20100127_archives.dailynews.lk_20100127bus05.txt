Jetliner to sail for corporate events

The Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau has tied up with Sri Lanka Navy to use the Jetliner ship formerly used for humanitarian operations as a venue for social and corporate events after refurbishment.

Chairman, Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, Bernard Goonatilake on the occasion of ceremonial launching of the vessel at the Colombo port said there is a huge potential which was not explored due to the war. "Now is the time to unleash this potential," he said.

The Jetliner is a water jet driven fast passenger ferry, which has been designed to accommodate 600 passengers and 160 cars at a time. The vessel is presently docked at the Colombo Port. It will serve shortly as a venue for social and corporate events.

Sri Lanka tourism has grown rapidly since the conflict was resolved in May 2009 with new products and services being introduced to the market and this is one of such expansion, Tourism Minister Achala Jagoda, the chief guest at the event said. Navy Commander Vice Admiral Thisara Samarasinghe said this vessel will introduce a maritime culture to the Sri Lankan population.

Although Sri Lanka is surrounded by the sea maritime culture was not in Sri Lanka earlier and therefore people must be educated on this potential which will change our economy, he said.
