Injury woes for Kenya ahead of World Twenty20 qualifiers

Kenya will be without all-rounders Thomas Odoyo and Ragheb Aga for next month's World Twenty20 qualifiers in Dubai because of injuries,the chairman of selectors Nassor Verjee said on Thursday.

The pair, who play league cricket in Zimbabwe and England respectively, will also not feature in the Intercontinental Cup match against Scotland in Nairobi later this month. But Verjee said the selectors have included several junior players in the squad, based on their recent performances and Cricket Kenya's long term objective for the team's future development.

Second-placed Kenya will meet leaders Scotland in the fight for top spot in the Intercontinental Cup series starting at the Nairobi Gymkhana club on January 25-28 before the two sides play in a Twenty20 tri-nation tournament, which will also involve Uganda.

Kenya is grouped in pool B alongside the Netherlands, Canada and the hosts UAE in the World Twenty20 qualifiers in Dubai in February where the top two teams will join the 10 Test nations in the third World Cup in the West Indies in April and May 2010.
