War won due to correct leadership - Minister

The war victory is a result of a collective effort made by the Head of the Armed Forces, Commanders of the three Forces and the Police. Some people are trying to claim credit saying they won the war because of that person and this person.

Thanks to the political leadership which took heroic and accurate decisions unbiased to West, the Forces were able to win the war, said Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Janaka Bandara Tennakoon. He was speaking at the opening of a new power plant at Galapamula in the Galewela Divisional Secretariat Division.

"Former leaders had to obey the west and stop the war even though victory was in sight.

Western countries tried to influence President Mahinda Rajapaksa in many ways to stop the war. Today we have the strength to stand on our feet as an independent nation because of the President's correct decision," the Minister said.
