SportsElton Chigumbura scored a solid 64 and spinner Prosper Utseya bagged two key wickets as Zimbabwe defeated Bangladesh by 38 runs in a triangular one-day series match here on Saturday.



 Zimbabwe rode on man-of-the-match Chigumbura's eighth half-century to post 205-9 before dismissing the hosts for 167, thanks to off-spinner Utseya's 2-22 off 10 tight overs.

 It was only Zimbabwe's second win in their last 12 one-day internationals against Bangladesh. The Africans take on Sri Lanka here on Monday.



 Each side will play two league matches before the top two qualify for the final on January 16.

 Skipper Utseya's decision to share the new ball with Edward Rainsford produced instant results as he grabbed two of the first four wickets to send the hosts reeling at 33-4.



 The spinner trapped opener Junaid Siddiqui leg-before for no score with his second delivery and then had skipper Mohammad Ashraful (18) caught by Vusimuzi Sibanda. He conceded just 13 runs in his opening seven-over spell.



 Shakib Al Hasan, who earlier bagged 3-23, alone offered a stiff resistance with an impressive 52 for his ninth half-century in one-day internationals. He also put on 59 for the fifth wicket with Raqibul Hasan (23).

 Bangladesh's chances receded sharply after the dismissal of Shakib, caught by wicket-keeper Tatenda Taibu while attempting to cut Chigumbura.



 Zimbabwe were earlier struggling at 94-5 after being put in to bat, but Chigumbura propped up the innings with a responsible knock under pressure.



 He hit five fours and a straight six off debutant seamer Mahbubul Alam in the last over before being run out.

 Bangladesh never allowed Zimbabwe to build a big partnership with their tidy bowling, with left-arm spinner Shakib and off-spinner Naeem Islam (3-32) doing the maximum damage.

 Stuart Matsikenyeri was Zimbabwe's second-highest contributor with a 51-ball 39, which included six fours.

Both batsmen made their individual career best scores.



 Kulatunga and Silva came together when Colts were struggling at 32-4 on the first day and extended their partnership of 238 runs yesterday by a further 115 runs to surpass the previous record of 317 runs (unbroken) set by former national captain Arjuna Ranatunga (200 n.o.) and Hemantha Wickremaratne (102 n.o.) for SSC against Sebastianites at Maitland Place in 1996/97.

 Thomians win spin dominated match

 In a match dominated by spinners S Thomas' Mt Lavinia came out victorious by four wickets against Isipathana in their 1st XI cricket fixture concluded at Mt Lavinia yesterday.

 The low scoring game was never a good one for the batsmen as spinners from both sides made inroads to the opposition's batting. Though Pathana hardly made an impression in their first essay, the Thomians also succumbed for 135 in their reply due to a superb piece of off-spin bowling by Sakuntha Premaratne (4/19). In their second innings Isipathana had a torrid time against the spin of MS Saleem (3/18) and Chamal Fonseka (5/41) who restricted them to 107. The Thomians left with a winning target of 128 lost six wickets getting there.

 Carey 69-4 contd 155 (61.5) (A Ajireen 53, M Ashik 35, SV Amarasinghe 4/35, TCI Kariyawasam 4/48) SYDNEY, (AFP) - The singles winners of this month's Australian Open will each receive two million dollars (1.4 million US), Tennis Australia said Saturday.

 Tennis Australia said it has increased the overall prize money pool for the year's opening grand slam tournament by 1.14 million dollars to 23.14 million dollars.



 TA said all of the increase in the prize pool would go to the singles finalists, with the men's and women's runners-up each receiving one million dollars.

 "This is an investment in the major revenue source for our sport in this country," TA chief executive Steve Wood said in a statement.



 "The Australian Open Grand Slam trophy is one of the most sought after prizes in world tennis. We want to work with the players to further elevate the status of the Australian Open.

 "We believe that two million dollars is an appropriate reward for winning the biggest sporting event in the world in January," he said.



 Wood said the dollar exchange rate did play a part in the timing of the announcement.

 "We announced a prize money increase in October for the same reason to further enhance the status of the Grand Slam of Asia Pacific," he said.



 "I also said at the time that we would monitor the exchange rate and review the situation closer to the event. We have done that and today's announcement is the end result."

 Wood said TA wanted to continue to grow the Australian Open in partnership with the players.

 The Australian Open takes place in Melbourne from January 19 to February 1. Wicketkeeper Brad Haddin will be rested from the two Twenty20 internationals against South Africa and will be replaced in the Australian side by West Australian Luke Ronchi.

 Haddin's workload in Test series against India, New Zealand and the Proteas has led to the decision to rest him ahead of the five-match one-day series against South Africa beginning on Friday. 

 "Brad arrived in Melbourne yesterday feeling the effects of his heavy workload over the past three months," Australia's chairman of selectors Andrew Hilditch said in a statement. 



 "In accordance with our policy of managing the workloads of players involved in all three forms of the game, it was decided that he would benefit from not playing in the two Twenty20 internationals.



 "Given the high intensity of Twenty20 cricket and the upcoming schedule of one-day international matches, it was decided that this was an appropriate time to manage Brad's workload with his and the Australian team's long-term interests in mind.

 "It now provides a deserved opportunity for Luke Ronchi to come back into the Australian squad after he impressed in the West Indies last year."



 Ronchi, who last year played four one-day internationals and a Twenty20 match in the West Indies, was at Melbourne airport preparing to return home to Perth when asked to join the national squad. 



 "I'd literally driven out to the airport, had my bags about to go on the conveyor belt and jumped straight back in a taxi and drove all the way back," said Ronchi, who had played for Western Australia against Victoria at the MCG on Thursday night. 

 Ronchi, 27, said he was focused on enjoying himself keeping to Australia's fast bowlers. 



 "I've just got to do my job and have fun and from there hopefully it all works out for itself," he said. 

 "More than anything just go out there and have some fun because I'm not here for long." 

 Australia plays South Africa in Twenty20 internationals at the MCG on Sunday and the Gabba on Tuesday. is the best, but not for long - Scolari Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari admits Cristiano Ronaldo deserves to be crowned the world's best player but he has warned the Manchester United winger he could lose the title in 2009. Ronaldo is favourite to collect the FIFA World Player of the Year award for 2008 when it is presented in Zurich on Monday. 



 The Portugal star, who is nominated alongside Liverpool striker Fernando Torres, AC Milan playmaker Kaka and Barcelona duo Lionel Messi and Xavi, has already won the European honour and Scolari is convinced his superb form for United last season deserves another reward. But the Brazilian knows Ronaldo better than most after coaching him with the Portugal national team for five years and he hinted that the United idol has been below par so far this season. 



 "In the last season, for me, he was the best in the world. If he doesn't receive the award it will be wrong,'' Scolari said. 

 "He is a very intelligent player that changes games. When you expect him to be on the left, he turns up on the right. When you expect him to shoot with his left, he shoots with his right. 



 "But this season maybe some other players are in a good position to discuss it.'' 

 Ronaldo scored 42 goals to help United win the Barclays Premier League and Champions League last season, but he spent most of the close season unsuccessfully trying to engineer a move to Real Madrid and has cut a forlorn figure at times since then. The 23-year-old has scored just nine times and has failed to hit the net in his last eight appearances, yet he could easily prove Scolari wrong by helping United to a crucial win over Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday. 



 He only made a cameo appearance as a substitute in the 1-1 draw between the teams at Stamford Bridge earlier this season. Now the stage is set for a more significant contribution. Scolari knows none of his Chelsea players have Ronaldo's flamboyant skills but he believes the likes of Deco, Frank Lampard, Michael Ballack and Joe Cole are just as capable of winning a match on their own. 



 "I have some players who don't have his characteristics but I have others who have fantasy,'' he said. "They cross very well and pass very well. [AFP] Zico to take up reins at CSKA Moscow Brazilian legend Zico will take up the coaching reins at one of Russia's top football teams, CSKA Moscow, the club said Saturday on its website.



 The Brazilian, 55, has signed a three-year contract with the club, CSKA said.

 Zico replaces Valery Gazzaev, who stepped down at the end of last year after leading CSKA to three national titles, four Russia Cups and a UEFA Cup victory.



 Zico joins the Moscow side from Uzbekistan's Bunyodkor, terminating his contract early with the team he took over only in September.



 From July 2006 to June 2008 Zico coached Fenerbahce, leading them to the Turkish title in 2007.

 Earlier Zico coached Japan's national team, leading them to the Asian champions title in 2004. SYDNEY, (AFP) - The singles winners of this month's Australian Open will each receive two million dollars (1.4 million US), Tennis Australia said Saturday.

 The Australian Open takes place in Melbourne from January 19 to February 1. BRISBANE, (AFP) - Spain's Fernando Verdasco will meet Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic in the final of the Brisbane International after contrasting victories over French opponents on Saturday.

 Verdasco crushed Paul-Henri Mathieu 6-2, 6-1 in 75 minutes in the first semi-final before Stepanek outlasted Richard Gasquet 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 in two hours 12 minutes in the second.



 Verdasco played almost faultless tennis as he blasted his way past Mathieu, the world number 32.

 The second seeded Davis Cup winner dominated his French opponent in every department as he raced through the match.

 He broke Mathieu three times in the first set and twice in the second as he showed the form that took him to world number 16 at the end of 2008.



 Mathieu had been in great form leading up the semi-finals, not dropping a set in the previous rounds.

 But he had no answer to Verdasco's booming ground strokes and looked a disconsolate figure at the end of the match.

 "I think that I'm playing some of the best tennis of my career," Verdasco said afterwards.

 "There were a few matches last year when I felt really good and now I'm feeling like that, or maybe even a bit better.

 "I have practised really hard physically in the pre-season and I'm feeling really strong and this is helping me so much."

 Gasquet appeared certain to become the only Frenchman out of seven who started the tournament to reach the final when he raced away with the first set of his semi-final against Stepanek.



 He broke Stepanek twice in the opening set and was playing as well as he did when he upset countryman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in Friday's quarter-finals.

 However, Gasquet appeared to tire as the match went on and the 30-year-old Stepanek came back into the contest.

 He broke in the fifth and seventh games of the second set to level the match -- his athleticism proving too much for Gasquet to handle.



 The two players traded service breaks early in the third set, with games staying on service until the ninth when Stepanek took advantage of some poor serving to make a crucial break.

 He then comfortably served it out to reach his eighth ATP final and his first since San Jose in February 2008.

 It is the second match in a row where Stepanek has had to come back from a set down.



 "I don't care much if it (winning) is the easy way or the hard way -- what's important for me is always the last point," he said.

 "I think we played high quality tennis for the whole match. I think I was the one who was more active in the last two sets -- I was more aggressive, trying to finish the points at the net and I think that was the difference between us today."
