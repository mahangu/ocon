Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse NewspapersI am very happy to have been able to save the lives of Sri Lankan cricketers, said Pakistani driver Meher Mohammad Khalil when Chairman, Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd (ANCL) Bandula Padmakumara contacted him over the telephone yesterday.

Last week, the ANCL sent an invitation to Mohammad Khalil through the Pakistan High Commission in Colombo, to visit Sri Lanka for a week's fully paid holiday. "This is a token of our appreciation and gratitude for your courageous action in saving the lives of our valued cricket team when they came under terrorist attack," the ANCL invitation said.

He expressed his willingness to visit Sri Lanka. He is 38 years old and has worked in the Pakistan Cricket Board as a driver for 22 years.

He has four children, two sons, Jawad (10 years), Ussama (13 years) and two daughters Shaviash (7 years) and Liapa (4 years).

Sports Minister Gamini Lokuge yesterday told the Daily News that he will host a dinner to Meher Mohammad Khalil during his visit.

The Minister also pledged to present an award of US $ 5,000 to Khalil as a token of appreciation for driving the Sri Lankan cricket team to safety when they came under attack last Tuesday in Lahore.

National Telecom provider Sri Lanka Telecom and Sri Lankan Telecom Mobitel have come forward to join hands with the Sports Ministry in facilitating the visit, said Leisha de Silva Chandrasena, Chairperson of Telecom and Mobitel Sri Lanka. She has also pledged to award US $ 5,000 to Khalil.

The National Pakistani daily Dawn last week carried the news of the ANCL offer prominently.

The ANCL is also inundated with requests from companies to sponsor events of the program connected with Khalil's visit.
