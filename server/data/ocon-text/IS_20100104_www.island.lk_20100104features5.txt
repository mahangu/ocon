The beginning of the financial year in most international businesses is April, and senior executives get together and talk about money.

But the beginning of the calendar year for most people is January, and I sit down with my children and we talk about pocket money.

My experience is that the two confabs are almost IDENTICAL, right down to the fighting over snacks and the sneaking of toys into the room.

Yet there's one big difference, which is particularly clear this year. Adults make wildly wrong decisions about money. Kids get things right by instinct. Indeed, I would go so far as to say: Everything you need to know about money you can learn from your kids.

1. Girls eventually stop buying toys, but boys never do.

2. If you have a tiny, completely useless bit of money and you put it in a savings account and wait for a year, you find that at the end of the year it is still a tiny, completely useless bit of money.

3. Some people will pay a premium for stuff that is shiny, but the smart ones don't.

4. Spending money feels good, but coming out of shop without having spent any feels even better.

5. They say that "money talks", but it doesn't. It just kind of lies there.

6. The amount of pocket money you lend to someone is never the amount you get back. Whether you get more, less, or none of it back depends on how well you chose the kid you lent it to.
