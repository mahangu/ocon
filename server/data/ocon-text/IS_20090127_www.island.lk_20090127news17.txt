National Flag will fly over all of Sri Lanka on Independence Day â€“ Dinesh

"Our hope is to hoist national flag throughout Sri Lanka on Independence Day. We can also hoist the national flag of the separatist's de-facto capital Kilinochchi," Urban Development and Sacred Area Development Minister Dinesh Gunawardena said yesterday.

He was addressing a ceremony to commission the Ethulgama North Community Water Supply Project at Pahatha Hewaheta in Kandy. "Today we are passing a very decisive stage in the history of our nation. We are almost at the end of 20 year long separatist war. Our valiant troops marching forward under the leadership banner of President Mahinda Rajapaksa to wipe the scourge out of our motherland," he said.

Though the Government spends a lot for the liberation of innocent Tamils used as human shields by the LTTE, it has not forgotten development programmes, such as Gama Neguma, Maga Neguma and Jathika Saviya to reawaken the village economies and infrastructure. "Our ministry is working towards the goal of providing every man in the island with the facility of safe drinking water. Almost all areas have been examined and villages that need water projects have been identified. Community water supply projects would be given the highest priority", he said.

The Minister emphasized that development and water were interlaced. Therefore, community participation is important to conserve water resources to meet any imminent water problems such as drought.

The Ministry activated 444 Community Water Supply Projects in 187 Grama Niladhari divisions in the Kandy District. These projects would provide safe water for 43937 families.

Principal of the Siridhammarathana Pirivena, Ven Dodamwela Dhammarathana Thera, Kandy Director of Community Water Supply Projects, W. M. D. K. Weerasekara and former PC member Mahinda Abeykoon also participated on the occasion.
