The implementation of the submission of living certificates by personally signing them before the Grama Niladaries, which are expected from the pensioners, is indeed a hassle for most of them who are old, infirm, sick and who find it difficult to trek to the GNs offices periodically. This has been devised invariably to avoid unscrupulous people drawing deceased pensioner's payments by impersonation. This objective can be easily achieved by following any one of the following ways:-

a. Paying officer should be more vigilant in identifying the correct payee by proper Identity cards or other relevant documents;

b. The pension receipt reintroduced recently by the Department can be insisted on making payments; or

c. Since each Grama Niladari division has been restructured recently to cover a reduced area, the G.N should be able to intimate the respective Pension branches in every Divisional Secretary about the death of a pensioner simultaneously with the issues of a death certificate.
