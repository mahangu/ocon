Fourth seed Caroline Wozniacki also got her campaign off to a positive start when she beat Canada's Alexsandra Wozniak 6-4, 6-2 in a match held over from the previous day.

However, all the attention in Melbourne was on the second round classic between former champion Henin and world number five Dementieva, a match which lived up to all expectations when Henin beat the Russian 7-5, 7-6 (8/6).

Playing just her second tournament since returning from an 18-month retirement, Henin outlasted Dementieva in two hours, 50 minutes of pulsating tennis.
