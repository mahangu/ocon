The Army has launched a programme to collect all items left behind by the residents of Vanni who fled to Vavuniya and hand them over to the owners now in refugee camps run by the Government.

The items left behind include cattle, poultry and vehicles. The Army is in the process of handing over these items to the owners with the help of other IDPs who had fled the Kilinochchi and Mannar districts after the military captured areas earlier held by the LTTE.

If the Army fails to find the real owners, such items would be kept in Police custody until the rightful owners claim them.

Already 800 push cycles, 125 motor cycles and 30 tractors have been brought to Vavuniya by the Army and handed over to their owners.
