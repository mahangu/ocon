The Island-BusinessOn the eve of its 51st anniversary, Central Finance Company PLC (CF), maintains the best rating amongst the Registered Finance Companies. Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed the Company's National Long-term rating at 'A+ (lka)'. "The Outlook is Stable", Fitch Ratings Lanka announced in a press release.

A Company spokesman explained "In continuing to enjoy the A+(lka) rating for the past three years, Central Finance has proved its strong financial position, good asset quality, solvency and strong capital position relative to peers in the financial sector".

Over the past half century, Central Finance has expanded to become one of the most respected financial services companies in the country. Starting with a modest capital of Rs 170,000, CF currently has Shareholder funds of Rs.6.6 billion as at end September 2008.

Profit after tax has exceeded a billion rupees in the past three years recording Rs 1,048 million in 2007/08, increasing from Rs 1,024 million in the previous year. Operating income increased from Rs 1,003 million to Rs 1,066 million in 2007/08.

Fitch pointed out that "Consequently, Net NPL/Equity ratio was 21.6% at H109 (17.3% at FYE08)", while adding "Although the majority of CF's assets are financed by customer deposits, growth has been increasingly funded by bank borrowings (17% of the funding mix at H109 versus 7% at FYE05). Interest rate swaps of LKR 2.6 bn at FYE08 (40% of borrowings at FYE08) have minimised market risk. Internal capital generation was strong, with high margins, low cost structures (cost/income ratio was 41% in H109) and a strong retention policy; overall capitalisation remained strong at 22% of assets at H109."

Meanwhile, CF's policy of diversifying into new ventures has paid dividends. CF Insurance Brokers (Pvt) Ltd, for instance, continues to be the country's leading insurance broker.

The investment in its associate company, Nations Trust Bank PLC (NTB) has brought in encouraging returns. NTB's net interest income increased by 23% last year to record Rs 2,110 million. Profit after tax of Rs 505 million showed an increase of 56% over the previous year.
