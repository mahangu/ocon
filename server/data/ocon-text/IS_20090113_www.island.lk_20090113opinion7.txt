The whole nation salutes and rejoices in the victory of our brave soldiers - from the Army Commander, Lt Gen. Sarath Fonseka, to the lowest ranking soldier for the courage, determination, and dedication to take back the land that was pirated by the LTTE. Thinking back on the origin of this conflict, one should feel sad to see thousands of young lads, killed, maimed and wounded on both sides - Sinhalese and Jaffna Tamils, for the fault of our politicians, both Sinhala and Tamil, who could not keep the nation together. With this victory, let us not rejoice over the vanquished but give serious thought to building national unity. This could be done or achieved by weeding out politicians who are corrupt. If one looks at the present set of politicians/parliamentarians, whom do we find? Some are alleged murderers with pending cases in courts - ironically holding ministerial posts with all perks, inclusive of housing allowances, etc. Some charged for fraud, forgery and you name any crime, a politician is said to be at the bottom of it.

This victory should be the beginning of the next major offensive against another kind of terrorism facing this country which is corruption, bribery and lawlessness.

Editors of newspapers, specially 'The Island" had voiced these sentiments over and over again in scathing language but with what effect? The nominations to the Provincial Councils, Central and Wayamba, shows that the powers that be are immune to public opinion. When will we come out of this quagmire?
