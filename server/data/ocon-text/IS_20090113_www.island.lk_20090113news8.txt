Passengers in a Colombo bound bus from Piliyandala panicked at the sight of an unattended parcel and after asking the driver to stop the vehicle ran helter skeelter for cover for fear it could be a bomb.

The police was summoned but at that moment a man came running, boarded the bus and took the object claiming that it was his but he got off the bus forgetting to take it along with him. It was found to be a video camera. (NP)
