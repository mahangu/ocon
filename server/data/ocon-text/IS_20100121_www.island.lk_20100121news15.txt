National Freedom Front leader Wimal Weerawansa, MP, yesterday said that he had informed IGP Mahinda Balasuriya regarding their plan to trap UNP National List MP Myown Mustapha and presidential advisor Nazeer Ahmed after they offered a Rs. 30 million bribe to UPFA National List MP M. Muzamil to switch his allegiance to the Fonseka camp.

Addressing a media conference at Mahaweli centre, he said that the IGP was briefed four days before the NFF exposed the UNP strategy.

He said that they had refrained from alerting other agencies to prevent the Fonseka camp receiving prior information regarding their move to trap Mustapha and Ahmed.

He said that Muzamil was promised Rs. 30 million though he received Rs. 4.2 million advance payment. The bag containing the money carried a name of an establishment belonging to a top UNPer, he said.
