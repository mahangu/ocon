Jaya slams police for 'inaction' on ads featuring LTTE chief

Terming the fast by Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katch leader Thol Thirumavalavan on the Sri Lankan Tamils issue as a "drama", AIADMK chief J. Jayalalithaa slammed the police for "failing" to take action against the VCK for issuing advertisements in newspapers with pictures of LTTE leader V. Prabhakaran.

In a statement in Chennai, she said the four-day fast had brought no end to woes of Tamils in Sri Lanka. "The drama was conducted to divert the attention of people of Tamil Nadu. The fast could not stop the war in Sri Lanka and no result has been drawn favouring the Tamils by it."

Referring to advertisements about the fast issued in vernacular media in Chennai carrying pictures of Prabhakaran and Thirumavalavan, she said it was an "anti-national" act.

Pointing out to the sporadic incidents of tourching and stoning of buses in different parts of the state allegedly by VCK activists, she said this had put people under hardships.

She alleged that the ruling DMK men were behind these incidents and criticised the state police for warning those involving in vandalism after the leader called off his fast.
