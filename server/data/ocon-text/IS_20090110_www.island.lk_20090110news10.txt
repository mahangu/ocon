The proscription of the LTTE is a welcome decision of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Most Venerable Mahanayaka Theras of Malwatte and Asgiriya said on Wednesday (08).

Most Venerable Tibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera said, the LTTE led by Prabhakaran was responsible for the loss of valuable lives of innocent civilians in great numbers during the last two decades.

Ban on the ruthless organization even at the late stage was a welcome step taken by President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the prelate added.

Ven. Anamaduwe Dhammadassi Thera, Secretary General of Asgiriya Chapter speaking for the Most Venerable Mahanayaka Udugama Sri Buddharakkitha Maha Thera said, he fully agreed with the decision taken by President Mahinda Rajapaksa to ban on the LTTE.

The LTTE created chaos in the country for nearly three decades by destroying invaluable lives and properties of the country and succeeded in setting back the progress of the land, the prelate said.

Even at this late stage when the LTTE was taking a thorough beating the leader Prabhakaran did not wish to lay down arms and surrender. The imposition of the ban on such an unyielding organization was the best solution, he added.
