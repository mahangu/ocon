English Language Training and Personality Development

A continuous one month workshop on English Language Training and Personality Development was inaugurated on January 12 at the Hambantota Community Centre under the guidance of Vocational and Technical Training Minister Piyasena Gamage and based on a concept of Tharunyata Hetak Chairman Namal Rajapaksa.

This program is funded by World Wide Resilience (WWR) and Resilience International Institute of Higher Learning (RIHL) in the Netherlands and the training delivery will be done by Orient Academy (Pvt) Ltd.

Sixty youth from the Hambantota District have been selected to participate in this result and research oriented English Langauge training and Personality Development pilot program.

There are a number of skilled personnel who are willing to work abroad to earn valued foreign exchange and to develop their skills further but, almost all of them do not posses the required English communication skills to compete in the international job market. Poor langauge skills place Sri Lankan youth at a disadvantage. Thousands of employment opportunities are lost due to lack of English langauge skills required for such employment. The program will be subject to comprehensive review which includes the following elements on completion.

* The Key Results: 60 (Sixty) youth will be able to carry out a satisfactory English conversation without fear of speaking.

* Participants will have an active vocabulary of at least 1000 words.

* Transformation of their personalities towards interaction with local and foreign dignitaries.

Depending on the findings of this pilot program a series of similar will be conducted islandwide.
