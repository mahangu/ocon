The story of Selyn is like most success stories, extraordinary and inspirational. It starts off in small beginnings, hardship and with the motivation of a single woman to be an entrepreneur. However, what is different about Selyn is that this story is a living one and a story without an end.

Sandra started 'Selyn' with a group of 12 women in her home garage around 15 years ago during the decline of the industry. Being a Sri Lankan woman with children this venture was met with skeptical thoughts from most of the society around her. Today she is the CEO of a company which records a considerably high turnover in handloom exports in Sri Lanka. She with her brother, Hilary, manages over 3 work shops and many sub-contract work places that provide the livelihood for many women and men specially in the North Western Province. She has gained national and international exposure and recognition for 'Selyn' and is today one of the most successful businesswomen in Kurunegala. 'Selyn' is now an oasis for the redundant workers of former state-owned handloom factories that continues to keep alive the traditions of an ancient craft. Sandra's little dream is now a real one and it continues go grow day by day; becoming bigger and better

One can say that this is a classic story of the empowerment of a woman who was driven with purpose. However this story is not at its end. In this presentation we wiII focus on the women of 'Selyn'. Sandra's story is a known one but behind her story there are many others which are also success stories of their own. Selyn has made it possible for all these women we will speak of today to be an entrepreneur and to be empowered.
