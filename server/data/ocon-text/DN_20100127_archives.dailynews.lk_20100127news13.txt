Historic kovil to be developed

The Government has taken measures to develop the historic, sacred Thiruketheeswaram kovil in Mannar for the convenience of a large number of devotees coming from both Sri Lanka and India.

Northern Province Governor Major General G.A.Chandrasiri said a plan has already been drawn up to complete the development of infrastructure facilities under the first phase before Maha Sivarathri day which falls on March 13, 2010.

He said that the Government has allocated Rs.270 million for this project. Accordingly, the main access road leading to the Kovil and Palavi water tank situated by the side of the Kovil will be reconstructed during the first phase.

He said that President Mahinda Rajapaksa has declared Thirukethieswa-ram Sacred City for Hindus. This was the first time an area where an ancient Hindu Temple is located has been declared as the Sacred city in Sri Lanka.

Since 1990, religious activities conducted at the kovil were badly interrupted due to LTTE terrorist activities which became a major obstacle for the improvement of the area. The Governor participating at the progress review meeting on Thirukethees-waram kovil recently, instructed the relevant officials to expedite the development work under the first phase to facilitate the devotees attending the "Maha Sivarathri Puja" which is expected to be conducted on a grand scale on March 13.

He further said once the Thiruketheeswaram Temple and surrounding roads were repaired and constructed, devotees coming to the Thiruketheeswaram kovil will have easy access to it.
