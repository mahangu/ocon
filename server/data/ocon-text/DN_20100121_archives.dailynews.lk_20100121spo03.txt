Professional, Anura Rohana a seasoned campaigner in being an extraordinary golfer played well within himself with a one under par 70 to lead on day one in round one of the Men's Open Golf Championship at the Ridgeways.

Rohana with his mature experience and growing confidence displayed golf of a high order yesterday, with a 5 under par 66 to maintain the lead on round two as well. In the first round on Tuesday where he finished one under par 70, he bogeyed the 3rd and 5th hole, but was quick enough to make up for it by having 4 birdies on the 2nd, 7th, 12th and 16th holes. Rohana in the second round did extremely well despite bogeying the 4th hole in having 6 birdies in 2nd, 5th, 7th, 12th, 16th and 18th.

Rohana has a 8 shot lead over fellow professional Lalith Kumara who shot a one under par 70 for a total of 144. Wijitha Bandara and Tiss Chandradasa, who are in the SA Games teams are lying 5th and 6th respectively.With the third round to be played today and the fourth on Friday the championship is as competitive to be fairly open.
