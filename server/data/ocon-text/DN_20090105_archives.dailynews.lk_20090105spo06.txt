Safin to retire in 2009

Russian superstar Marat Safin arrived here fresh from a New Year brawl to score a comfortable victory on Sunday and confirm that 2009 would likely be his last year on the circuit. Safin, who was sporting a black eye and facial swelling after his encounter in Moscow - which he said he had 'won' - cruised past Italy's Simone Bolelli at the mixed teams Hopman Cup.
