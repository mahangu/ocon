Teacher trade unionists yesterday decided to stage a massive protest against the government, over its failure to rectify the anomalies in their salaries by December 31 as promised.

They had earlier planned an islandwide strike but abandoned their campaign after the Cabinet had given an assurance that their salary anomalies would be rectified by the end of 2007.

The All Ceylon United Teacher's Union (ACUTU), Ceylon Teachers Service Union (CTSU), Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU), Education Professionals Association (EPA) and Lanka Home Science and Agriculture Diploma Teachers Union had earlier boycotted the G. C. E. (A/L) answer script evaluation but had to end it on a Court order.

General Secretary of the CTSU Mahinda Jayasinghe told The Island yesterday that they had written to Prime Minister Rathnasiri Wickramanayake to intervene and solve the problem. But, there had been no response. The Ministry is passing the buck on to the National Salaries and Cadres Commission (NSCC).

He said that they don't want to cripple the new school term. But if they had to resort to trade union action, the blame should be borne by the NSCC and the cabinet of ministers.

Education Minister Susil Premajayantha said that the NSCC had earlier promised to submit its recommendations yesterday.

"I informed to Secretary of the Cabinet that the recommendations would be forwarded to the Cabinet as soon as I receive them," Minister Premajayantha said.
