Ministry to enhance support for elders pleading for aid from their children

by Ifham Nizam

The Social Services and Social Welfare Ministry has taken steps to provide legal aid services throughout the island for the maintenance and welfare cases of elderly persons.

Ministry sources said yesterday that they took this decision following a number of complaints made by the parents and a number of detections made where children had neglected the welfare of their parents.

The 2000 Parliament Act No. 9 under clause 15 (1) states that children should not consciously neglect their parents and it is the duty and the responsibility of children to look after their needs.

Ministry officials yesterday said that steps had been taken to broaden the services provided by Maintenance Board at the National Secretariat for Elders at 150/A LHP Building, Nawala Road, Nugegoda.

In this regard the Judicial Service Commission had requested assistance from the Legal Aid Commission for the Elders' Maintenance Committee to function under the supervision of a retired judge of the Supreme Court.

Legal officers attached to the 46 centres island-wide of the Legal Aid Commission had shown their willingness to take up matters and issues relating to elders.

This would make it more convenient for those elders living in outstations to obtain their services without coming to Colombo.
