KANDY - Both the ruling UNP and the Opposition of the Kandy Municipal Council condemned the continuing assaults on mediamen and media institutions in Sri Lanka.

At meeting of the Kandy Municipality chaired by mayor L. B. Aluwihare, UNP member Raja Pushpakumara said attacks on media personnel and media institutions are cowardly acts of politicians who have no courage to tolerate criticism.

Those political cowards are responsible for the attack on the Sirasa Media Network, killing of Sunday Leader editor, Lasantha Wickrematunge and the latest brutal attack on Rivira Editor Upali Tennakoon and his wife, Raja Pushpakumara said.

In the past there were admirable politicians of the calibre of Minister A. C. S. Hameed and Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike who could not be provoked by criticism by the media. They always tolerated the cartoons in the newspapers which were very harsh on them at times, Pushpakumara said.

Great personalities in politics take media criticism in good spirt, he said.

Sena Dissanayake (UPFA) Former Opposition Leader, condemned the attack on the Media institutions and journalists.

Those responsible for such wickedness must be apprehended and punished, Sena Dissanayake said.

Media personnel should be allowed the freedom to enjoy their rights to criticise. The present trend to silence the media should be checked, Dissanayake further said.
