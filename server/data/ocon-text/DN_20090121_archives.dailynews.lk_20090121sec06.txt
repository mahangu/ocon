Lankan refugees lock up cop

The special camp for Sri Lankan Tamil refugees near Poonamallee witnessed tumultuous scenes on Monday after an inspector was locked inside the camp.

The 26 inmates at the refugee camp locked up K Loganathan, crime inspector, Shankar Nagar police station, for over an hour inside the camp after officials refused to provide treatment at a private hospital to one of the inmates suffering from jaundice.

The special refugee camp in Karayanchavadi, near Poonamallee, set up for housing the accused in Rajiv Gandhi's assassination, was recently used for housing sensitive persons from the various Sri Lankan Tamil refugee camps.

One inmate, C. Sivakaran 30, who was shifted from a Chengalpattu refugee camp, was allegedly suffering from jaundice from August 2008. He had undergone treatment at the Chengalpattu government general hospital, but it did not help him. He then sent a petition to the Thiruvallur district tahsildar seeking permission to undergo treatment at the Meenakshi hospital in Maduravoyal and offered to pay for the treatment himself.

Police said that inmates had received news that Sivakaran's petition was rejected on Monday morning. Their anger was aggravated by the fact that they were also not receiving their daily ration of Rs. 45 since January 16. The inmates then locked up Loganathan, refusing to let him out until treatment was provided for Sivakaran.

Following this, the Thiruvallur district tahsildar forwarded their petition to K. Sundaramoorthy, Thiruvallur district collector, who granted permission for Sivakaran to be moved to a private hospital.

Police said that Loganathan was let out at about 1 pm and that the situation returned to normal after Sivakaran was taken to the hospital.
