* National ICT Excellence Award - A programme to reward the innovative skills of schools, teachers and students

Q: Do you believe that the existing funds allocated for 2009 will be enough for all these vast scale programmes?

A: Definitely, the ministry has allocated fixed financial allocations to run these special programmes through the Asian Development Bank funded Education for Knowledge Society (EKSP Project) of our Ministry.

Q: You mentioned that you plan to provide 1500 schools with internet connectivity and open 1 million e-mail accounts in 2009. Do you believe that by providing the above facilities, you can see a huge improvement in ICT and English in the school education system?

A: Why not. Schoolnet is the ever largest Wide Area Network in the island providing safe internet access to the school community. At the end of 2009, Schoolnet facility will be expanded to a total of 3000 schools. E mail is only a one feature provided through Schoolnet. By becoming a Schoolnet browser there are many merits that principals, teachers and students can achieve. Tools for teaching learning process, educational software, web domain hosting for schools, learning management systems are some of the other main facilities provided through schoolnet. Presently, this facility has become more popularise among school community. Students and teachers surf Schoolnet 3 million times a day for educational purposes using English as the medium. It reflects the progress of improvement. So how can anybody say that by Schoolnet and emails ICT and English is not promoted?

Q: In addition to these, has your ministry implemented any programme to promote ICT to the villages?

A: Definitely, We have already started e-village concept in 15 schools and by the end of 2009 there will be additional 45 e-villages enabling villagers to share the cutting edge technologies of 21st century with rural communities.

Q: What is this e-village concept?

A: This initiative is an successful attempt to take the ICT benefits from the school to the village so that the entire village can develop with its school at the center. By this concept villages get social, economic and academic benefits. There are good examples where this concept has become very success. Not only the above, village youth are benefited with job opportunities through this concept. The ICT knowledge of the e-village students is considerably higher than those of the other.

Q: By organising all these seven special programs, what are the main aims of the ministry?

A: The ultimate aims are,

* By providing required ICT knowledge to teachers, spread it to the whole education system

* Using computer as a tool to teach different subjects in an effective and innovative ways

* By providing Computer learning Centers to the schools, encourage students to empower with 21st century abilities

* Enabling the students with 21st century job requirements when they leave the school

* A rewarding system for schools, teachers and students who use ICT in an innovative and effective way in the aim of promoting ICT.

Q: Are there appropriate number of teachers to teach ICT in schools? And does the knowledge of those ICT teachers enough to fulfil the student's knowledge requirement?

A: During the last five years, Secondary Education Modernisation Project of the Ministry of Education awarded nearly 90000 scholarships and required training opportunities to the teachers. Thus, the teachers were empowered to use the computer as a tool for teaching and the teachers are utilising it at optimum levels. In addition, that the Education for Knowledge Society Project of MoE has recently introduced International Pedagogical ICT scholarship programme among the Sri Lankan teacher community enabling 15000 teachers to be trained in that by the end of 2009. So, with these international qualified advanced and valued training teachers are empowered with the latest teaching learning methods and it has made a positive impact towards the educational sector.

Q: Are you confident that the ICT knowledge given to the teachers are delivered to the students in a good and effective manner?

A: Yes! There are many instances that I can prove such cases.We organized provincial education software competition a couple of years ago with 1000 entries and in 2007 it was 16500 entries and this year it has recorded a worthy 40000 entries by students and teachers with innovative educational software. I think this a very good example of knowledge transformation by teachers to the students.
