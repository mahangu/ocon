The Colombo High Court yesterday reissued an arrest warrants for LTTE leader, Velupillai Prabhakaran, head of LTTE intelligence wing Pottu Amman and two other senior members of the outfit in connection with the assassination of former foreign minister of Sri Lanka Lakshman Kadirgamar.

Judge Kumuduni Wickremasinghe issued the arrest warrant due to the absence of the four suspects when the case related to the assassination of Kadirgamar was heard this morning.

Charles Master and Komadee Manimekala are the other two wanted suspects.

Former Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar was assassinated by a LTTE sniper at his residence in Colombo 07 on August 12, 2005.

The police told Courts that they are unable to arrest the suspects due to the ongoing battles in the North.

The Interpol has also issued an arrest warrant on the LTTE chief. India also wants to arrest the LTTE chief for the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

Prabhakaran has already been sentenced by Colombo High Court in absentia for 200 years for the 1996 suicide bombing of the Central Bank in Colombo.
