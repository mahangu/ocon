The Island-BusinessElephant House Ice creams will exclusively partner the popular "Vedasa" Medical Exhibition which takes place at the BMICH in Colombo commencing Tuesday 06 until Monday 12 January.

Organised by the Medical Faculty of University of Sri Jayewardenepura, the objective of this exhibition will be the focus on good health and well being. It hosts a range of stalls depicting both the normality and abnormality of the central nervous system, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, renal, reproductive, special senses, sexually transmitted Diseases, AIDS, diabetes, childhood obesity, adolescence and health, physical exercise.

Head of Frozen Confectionary, Ceylon Cold Stores Neil Samarasinghe said that the Elephant House Light Range was specially selected for this event because the exhibition revolves around the concept of good health and well being and seeks to educate visitors on developments and medical wonders in the health sector.

The Elephant House sugar-free, low-calorie Lite Ice Cream range specifically promotes healthy lifestyles among thousands of health conscious Sri Lankan consumers and has enjoyed a steadily rising demand both in Sri Lanka and the neighbouring Maldives since its launch in 2007. "Internationally there is a growing consumer demand for low fat diet ice creams. Several global players have, in fact, invested heavily on introducing new generation light ice cream variants. As Sri Lanka's largest ice cream manufacturer, we too are very sensitive to the fact that diet foods are rapidly growing in popularity, especially in today's calorie-conscious Sri Lankan society", he added.
