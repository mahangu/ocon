Basnahira South, led by Tillakaratne Dilshan, enjoyed their first win on Tuesday, by defeating fancied Basnahira North by six wickets under the Duckworth-Lewis Method in their rain-hampered last preliminary round encounter played at the SSC grounds, Colombo.

Opener Ian Daniel hit the limelight after a long time in a first class match, by smashing a 75-ball 74 to guide his team to the win which left Vaas' side dependent on a favourable result in the Wayamba vs. Kandurata encounter to be played this Friday (11).

Daniel's domination in the middle was graced by five fours and two sixes as afternoon rains reduced their target to 175 in 36 overs. Basnahira Northerners made a modest 207 for nine in their fifty overs leaving a manageable task for Dilshan's side as they now could fancy their chances of entering the final by doing well in their last match on Friday against Ruhuna.

Kandurata were closing in on a possible third consecutive win in the Inter-Provincial Tournament as their opposition on Tuesday, Ruhuna, were struggling at 192 for seven in their 36th over, while chasing a massive 282 to win in 47 overs, at the time this edition went to press.

A timely 71, made in 96 balls with seven fours, by Tilan Samaraweera and a brisk 63 in 65 balls, inclusive of two fours and three sixes, by Chamara Kapugedera helped Kandurata take control of the game played at the R. Premadasa Stadium under lights. Kandurata made 284 for eight in their innings reduced to 49 overs.

Kandurata were propped up by a scintillating 47, made off just 27 balls with a four and four sixes, made during the death overs by No. 6 bat and former Test cap Thilina Thushara.

Upul Tharanga (50 in 33) and Indika de Saram (52 in 44) helped Ruhuna remain in contention for their first win of the tourney but the Kandurata bowlers, spearheaded by Thushara (2-24) never allowed the game to go beyond their control.
