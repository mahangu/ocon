UNP MP Dayasiri Jayasekara told Parliament that he has received anonymous phone calls threatening him with death if he continues to raise his voice against the Government.

The MP said he received a death threat to his mobile phone around 10.19 p.m. on Thursday from a land phone number 0112889991. "A male person said that I would enjoy the same fate experienced by Sunday Leader editor Lasantha Wickremethunga if I do not stop criticizing the Government with immediate effect," he said.

Speaker Lokubandara reminded the MP that it was question time, but the MP said he was raising a point of order. "I was told that it was the first and last warning that I would get in this regard. The call was terminated and though I tried several times to contact that number it continued to be engaged. I forward this number to you Mr. Speaker and request that security should be provided to me taking the current situation in the country into consideration. Today, not even an MP but a normal citizen cannot utter a word against the Government because that could be the cause of his death. I request you Sir to take action to protect my rights and privileges as a parliamentarian to express my views freely," MP Jayasekara said.

Speaker W. J. M. Lokubandara said that he would bring this complaint to the notice of the Inspector General of Police and if Police agrees, the security for the MP would be increased.
