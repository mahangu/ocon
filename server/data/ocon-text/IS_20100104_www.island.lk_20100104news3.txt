Bunkering facilities receive a boost with re-opening of northern entrance

by Shamindra Ferdinando

Following the re-opening of the northern entrance to the Colombo Port, the North pier will be used as a multi-purpose berthing facility to accommodate oil tankers. A senior SLPA official told The Island that it had launched operations on December 30 with the arrival of the oil tanker MT HEAVAN.

He said a state of the art oil pump pipeline had been constructed to connect the pier with the South Jetty for oil transportation and that would greatly bolster the port's capacity to carry out bunkering operations. According to him, the project had been handled by the SLPA with the help of its own engineers.

Earlier, the closure of the northern entrance owing to terrorist threats caused severe congestion at the port. Recently, the navy cleared the way for re-opening of the northern entrance.

Sources said that there were seven license holders authorised to engage in bunkering operations, including LMS, CPC, Lanka IOC, CSC Kandia, Inter Ocean and Hayleys.

Following the intervention of the Supreme Court, JCT (Pvt) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of SLPA, was tasked with the responsibility of managing the Oil Bank at the Bloemendhal facility. In keeping with the project, two new oil storage tanks would be built to boost the holding capacity.

He said that construction of one storage tank with a capacity of 5,200 metric tons was in progress while a survey was being conducted to explore the possibility of building another, though its capacity had not been decided yet.

Sources said that an issue confronting the Port was sharing of berthing facilities by creating a level paying field to avoid heavy losses to some players (license holders).

There are four 'oil inlets' into the country, with three of them being located in Colombo and at Trincomalee. Of the three inlets in Colombo, two are off-shore Single Point Buoy Moorings––one each for crude oil and refined products.
