Prices of essential items have been slashed in the wholesale market in Pettah with the release of adequate stocks at lower prices to the market.

A Pettah Wholesale Traders Association Spokesman said that prices of several varieties of rice, dhal, big onions and potatoes have gone down in the Pettah wholesale market due to imports of sufficient stocks of these items to the country.

Accordingly, a price of a kilo of white raw rice and basmathi has been reduced to the range of Rs 45-Rs 46 and Rs 71 to Rs 72 respectively in the whole sale market in Pettah.

In addition, a price of a kilo of big onion has dropped to Rs 68-Rs 70 while the price of a kilo of potatoes has come down to Rs 38 to Rs 40 in the Pettah wholesale market.

A kilo of dhall is sold between Rs 154-Rs 155 in the Pettah wholesale market.

He said that adequate stocks of potatoes, red onions,,dhall and big onions had also reached the wholesale market in Pettah.

Therefore, there is no shortage of essential items in the market as enough stocks of imported rice are continuously supplied by the private sector simultaneously to the state sector.

Meanwhile, the Government also took measures to release white raw rice (Sudu Kekulu) imported from Pakistan at the lower price of Rs 50 to consumers through all co-operatives across the country.

Therefore, price of white raw rice has been slashed in the market with the supply of adequate rice stocks. Consumers have the opportunity to purchase enough white raw rice stocks through Cooperative outlets in the country.

Any rice shortage is not anticipated in the future since enough rice stocks are released to the market.

Sufficient stocks of all essential items are available at Lak Sathosa, Co-op cities and Co-operatives across the country and people can buy them at lower prices.
