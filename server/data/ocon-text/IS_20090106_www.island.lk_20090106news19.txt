The Island-NewsThe heads of the two main private bus owners associations are at loggerheads over the reduction of bus fares stipulated by the National Transport Commission.

Lanka Private Owners Association Chairman Gemunu Wijeratne yesterday said that his association would reduce fares as stipulated by the government and there will be a reduction of around four percent from today. "Members of our association own around 18,000 private buses operating in the country and we have made a pledge to the government that we would adhere to its decisions. We must support the government at this juncture, and appreciate its positive approach on the war," he said.

However, did not mean that everything was rosy for the bus operators. Though the price of diesel had been reduced there were other expenses to be incurred and prices of those items had not been reduced, he said.

On the other hand though the railway is a government concern it had not taken a decision to reduce the fares yet, he said.

Just because the price of gas was reduced, the prices of bakery products were not reduced nor was the price of rice, he said.

Federation of All Ceylon Private Bus Operators President Stanley Fernando said that his association has taken a decision not to reduce bus fares and if the government uses force, to make them do so, they would strike in protest.

A senior member of the association alleged that the National Transport Commission (NTC) was not transparent in its dealings and due to the arbitrary action taken by a member of the hierarchy the private bus owners were facing many hardships.

The NTC said the Commission would stick to its decision and reduce bus fares as stipulated.

The minimum bus fare of Rs 6 and the next slab of Rs 9 will remain the same and there will changes in the other slabs depending on length of the journey.
