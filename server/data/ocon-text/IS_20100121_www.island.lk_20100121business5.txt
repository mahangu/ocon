Turnover tops a billion, both indices up sharply Bourse rebounds after Tuesday's decline

The Colombo bourse yesterday bounced back from Tuesday's decline with turnover topping the billion rupee mark and both indices catching up the ground lost the previous day, brokers said.

Turnover at Rs.1.2 billion was up from the previous day's Rs.739.8 million while the All Share Price Index gained 49.11 points (1.41%) and the Milanka 60.57 points (1.51%) with 125 advancers comfortably outpacing 26 decliners.

"The market bounced back from the previous day's fall with price revivals seen on most counters," Prashan Fernando of Acuity Stockbrokers said. "Retail interest particularly in Richard Pieris and Browns was most evident."

JKH, as on several previous days, continued to be the biggest turnover generator with 1.1 million shares traded between Rs.175 and Rs.178 gaining 50 cents to close at Rs.175 contributing Rs.185 million to the day's business volume.

Brokers said that there were some crossings of the blue chip conglomerate with most large parcels done yesterday being at the Rs.175 price.

The other three major contributors to turnover, in that order, were HNB, Browns and Aitken Spence with HNB gaining Rs.1.75 to close at Rs.172 on 0.6 million shares, Browns up Rs.5 to close at Rs.86 on nearly 1.2 million shares and Spence, up Rs.9.25 to close at Rs.1,250.75 on 65,500 shares.

NDB edged down 25 cents to close at Rs.202 on over 0.3 million shares while Haycarb, which has been moving up very sharply in recent days, was up Rs.16.25 to close at Rs.196.25 on over 0.3 million shares.

Among the banking stock, Commercial Bank was up a rupee to close at Rs.189 on nearly 0.3 million shares with HNB (non-voting) also gaining Rs.4 to close at Rs.114 on over 0.1 million shares and ComBank (non-voting), up Rs.2.75 to close at Rs.125 on nearly 0.1 million shares.

Environment Resource Investments (Walker & Greig) recovered ground lost the previous day both on the share and the two warrants with the share gaining Rs.10.50 to close at Rs.115.25 on nearly 0.3 million transacted while the two warrants were up Rs.5.50 and Rs.6.75 to Rs.91.50 on 0.3 million and 0.2 million respectively.

Brokers said that the market rebounding yesterday indicated positive sentiment ahead of next Tuesday's presidential election.
