MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) - Being favorite with the British bookmakers worked against Andy Murray at the Australian Open.

No. 14 Fernando Verdasco of Spain rallied to beat the 21-year-old Scot 2-6, 6-1, 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 on Monday to reach the quarterfinals at the season's first major.

The fourth-seeded Murray saved two match points after falling behind 40-0 in the last game but wasn't able to fend off a third, dumping a backhand into the net.

Murray, who lost in the U.S. Open final last year to Roger Federer, was attempting to become the first British man since 1936 to win a Grand Slam singles title.

After recent wins over No. 1-ranked Rafael Nadal and No. 2 Federer, Murray had grown in favoritism to beat them both for the Australian title.

Instead, it will be Verdasco, a key player in Spain's Davis Cup final triumph in Argentina, who moves into the quarterfinals against the winner of Monday's later match between 2008 runner-up Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and American James Blake.
