Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse NewspapersReversing to traditional food habits may help combat chronic renal disease spreading in the country, research revealed.

Chronic renal disease, commonly known as kidney failure is on the rise in the North Central Province and is likely to spread to other parts of the country, Gallege Punyawardana of the Swarna Hansa Foundation said.

"Agrochemical pollution in the water bodies of the area is the cause of the disease", Punyawardana said.

Prof. S. Bandara of the Peradeniya University who has conducted extensive research on chronic renal disease said, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), also known as Chronic renal disease is a progressive loss of renal function over a period of months or years.

Symptoms of worsening kidney function are unspecific and might include feeling generally unwell and a reduced appetite. "Usually the patients detect the kidney failure in the last stages of the disease as cadmium toxins accumulate over time," he said.

"The best we can do is to eat plenty of fibre like green leaves to trap the colloidal cadmium to remove it from the body," the Professor said.

He emphasised that people should reverse to traditional food habits and consume plenty of dietary fibre while prevent ingesting toxins like alcohol.

"The best natural method to purify reservoirs and water is to grow the lotus (Nelum) on river banks just like our ancestors," Prof. Bandara said.

He said Walbeli and Kumbuk were also good alternatives.

However, at the rate of development takes place, pollution is on the rise and even these solutions may be insufficient to stop the disease, the Professor added.
