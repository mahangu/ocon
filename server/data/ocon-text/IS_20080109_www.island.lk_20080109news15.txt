Former Prime Minister Torbjørn Jagland is not impressed with Norway's peace work abroad.

In an article by Kristoffer Rønneberg in Aftenposten (Jan 4) Jagland points to how Norway has failed to create peace in conflict affected countries and areas.

He mentions among other things the conflict in Sri Lanka where Norway has had an active role as peace mediators and observers.

This conflict has become considerably tense in the last few days after the government formally terminated the ceasefire agreement that was made with the LTTE in 2002.

The 20 Norwegian observers in Sri Lanka are now shutting down their six offices and have to leave the country by 16th January.

"It has been claimed that Norway could not have functioned as facilitator to the peace process if we were a member of the EU. But nearly all peace processes we have been involved in are in tatters," writes Jagland.

Jagland believes that a lot of it has to be blamed on "Norwegian politicians together with the press" who talk about Norway as an important global nation.

"This does not fit with Norway not being able to change anything in relation to the big global issues," writes Jagland.

"Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Støre and Development Minister Erik Solheim get most of the blame for Norway's failed peace policy," claims Jagland, who wants Norwegian authorities to cooperate more with large institutions like the EU and the UN instead of going solo.

"The global institutions that Norway has always built its altruistic foreign policy on, is deteriorating whilst our two ministers from the Foreign Ministry are traveling all around the world with all their little projects," writes Jagland.
