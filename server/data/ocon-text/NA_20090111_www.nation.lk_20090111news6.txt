 The Army yesterday afternoon completed the liberation of the entire Jaffna Peninsula when troops of the 55 Division drove out last of the LTTE presence between Nagarkovil and Vettilaikerni, in the northern part of the neck of Jaffna.



 On Friday, troops of 53 and 55 Divisions jointly wiped out LTTE presence up to Elephant Pass (EPS) having begun a fresh ground assault from Muhamalai last Monday. They completed their task by linking up with Commando units operating with the 58 Division who advanced northwards from Elephant Pass. On Monday troops of the 58 Division overran EPS ending the Tiger occupation of this gateway to Jaffna for nearly nine years.



 Meanwhile, the 59 Division yesterday captured a fourth Tiger airstrip situated south of Pudukuduirippu and five kilometres west of Mullaitivu Town. The facility included a 150-metre wide and 2.3-kilometre long runway and two empty armour plated hangars.

 By Friday evening the 59-2 and 59-3 Brigades were only few hundred metres from the Pudukuduirippu LTTE runway, and on its approaches they captured bunkers protected with bullet proof thick metal sheets, four containers and barrels containing aircraft fuel.



 At the same time, the 63-2 Brigade troops operating under the Task Force 111 too were close to capturing the main runways of the LTTE in Iranamadu, and were said to be within a kilometre of their target by last evening.



 The last rebel air attack was on October 29 last year when two LTTE light aircraft flew out of their hideouts in the north, and dropped bombs at the Kelanitissa Power Plant, and at the Thalladi main military camp in Mannar. 



 Though the Army has now captured four airstrips of the Tigers, it has so far not found a single Czech-built Zlin Z-143 light wing aircraft in LTTE possession. They are believed to be in possession of several of these aircraft used in previous bombing raids.
