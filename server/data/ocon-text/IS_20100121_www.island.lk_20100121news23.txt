The Divisional Co-ordinating Secretary of the UNP in Hakmana, K. A. Hemasiri has complained to the Supreme Court that on December 19, 2009, while he and some other supporters of the UNP and the UNF were pasting posters in Hakmana in support of Opposition Presidential candidate General (retd) Sarath Fonseka at the forthcoming poll, a police officer had abused the petitioner in obscene language and slapped him on the face.

The petitioner had started bleeding from the mouth and fainted. He had been admitted to the Matara Base Hospital for treatment.

The petitioner complained of discrimination on grounds of political opinion, assault and a denial of the freedom of expression.

The petition was supported by Upul Kumaramanna.

The Court granted leave to proceed and fixed the hearing for May 3, 2010.
