Chris Gayle has been cleared of serious injury following scans on his left-side, radiojamaica.com reported on its website on Wednesday.

It was feared the West Indies captain tore a muscle and would miss West Indies' one day series against Australia in February, when he retired hurt in Western Australia's loss to Kieron Pollard's South Australia on Tuesday in the Big Bash Twenty20 tournament.

Gayle returned to the middle after icing the injury in Tuesday's match and fell for 44 off 24 balls.

He will sit out Western Australia's match today, but will return to action for their third match on January 5, the report added.
