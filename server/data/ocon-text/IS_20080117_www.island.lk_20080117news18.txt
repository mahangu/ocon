In addition to the infrastructure development programmes in the Eastern Province implemented under the Negenahira Navodaya

Rehabilitation programme, the people in the region benefited very much from the mobile services provided by the Ministry of Public Administration and Home Affairs, Minister of Nation Building, Susantha Punchinilame told The Island yesterday (16).

Another mobile service will be held next Saturday and Sunday (19 &20) under the 180 day Negenahira Navodaya programme in the Trincomalee District and the people in the area will get an opportunity to obtain National Identity Cards and also get their land titles and deeds cleared. Most of these people who were farmers, needed water to for their neglected farmlands and the irrigation department had given their co-operation to repair and rehabilitate the irrigation systems neglected for many years, he said.

The fishing community in the coastal belt were given fishing gear and the reduction of curfew hours has given the community a relief, Punchinilame said.

A clear development of infrastructure had taken place in the Eastern Province under the Negenahira Udanaya 180 day programme. The Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment had opened a new centre to train people vying for employment abroad last Tuesday (16), so that the people in the Eastern Province need not go to Colombo get preliminary training and services provided by the SLBFE, the Minister said.

Nothing much was gained by the 180 day Negenhira Udanaya programme other than the issue of NICs, driving licences and work certificates, Nedun Chaliyan, an officials of the District Secretariat Batticaloa told The Island.

We received 10.8 million rupees to reconstruct ten temples in the district and we have completed the task, Chaliyan said.
