Local cricket board president and former West Indies wicket keeper Deryck Murray has welcomed superstar Brian Lara's return to the Trinidad and Tobago team for the Carib Beer Series, NationNews.com reported Sunday on its website.

Murray said the decision to rubberstamp Lara's participation in the opening match of the four-day series was a unanimous one by the executive of the local board.

"I welcome him from the point of view that any team will be happy to have Lara on their side because of his experience and knowledge. He will be a great asset to the T&T team," Murray was quoted as having said.

The 38-year-old batting star quit international cricket in April this year following the West Indies' dismal performance in the Cricket World Cup in the Caribbean.

He recently captained the Mumbai Champs to sixth place in the controversial Indian Cricket League, his first stint of action since his retirement.

Murray explained that immediately on Lara's announcement of his retirement from international cricket, the icon suggested he wanted to continue to play for Trinidad.

Murray said that cricket lovers in Trinidad would now have the opportunity to say thank you to Lara for his outstanding cricket career.

"We want to give him a proper send-off as a member of the national team. This is the ideal opportunity for the public to come out and say thank you to the great batsman," Murray said.

"This is a man who has created history in cricket, a son of the soil. We want you to come out and give him a proper send off, and in so doing, be supportive of the T&T cricket team."
