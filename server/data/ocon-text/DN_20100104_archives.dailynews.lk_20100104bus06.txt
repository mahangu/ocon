The location is ideal and unique. It is overlooking the lagoon. Just about 10 kilometers from Jaffna city and there is already a road way.

We are upbeat with this site and the support extended by all stakeholders in Jaffna and we will immediately get on with procedures required to work on this proposal", Vipula Wanigasekera said.

Not having the necessary infrastructure was the key issue in Sri Lanka that hindered the development of MICE industry ( Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions). The SLCB will now accelarate with its product development efforts to spread the MICE business throughout the country.

MICE visitors are high spenders and such business generate additional employment and repeat holiday visits hence the heavy focus of the countries such as Singapore and Malaysia on MICE tourism.

A State-of-the-Art convention centre is already coming up in Hambantota for which we are providing assistance to UDA. There are expansions taking place Colombo . BMICH is to be refurbished and have extended facilities.A site has also been identified in Negombo for a convention centre. Tourism development plan in the East takes into account the MICE component.

All these mean , we are heading for a bright future for MICE tourism in the coming years," Wanigasekera said.
