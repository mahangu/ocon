Eight leading business chambers and federations issued the following statement yesterday with regard to next week's presidential elections:

Following the eradication of the scourge of terrorism and the opportunity to propel the country into an unparalleled era of development, it is vital that the Presidential election to be held on Tuesday is conducted in a transparently free and fair manner.

Circumstances could not be more opportune for all sections of society to unite, regardless of political, ethnic, religious and other differences, to drive the country forward towards realizing its true potential, which can only be achieved through harmony and unrestrained co-operation.

As the date of the election draws closer, violence and confrontation between, particularly, the supporters of the two main candidates are progressively and alarmingly increasing and the flouting of Elections Laws is increasingly being reported. It is the responsibility of the political leaders to bring this situation to an immediate halt so as to ensure a peaceful environment throughout the country, preventing further hostility and bloodshed.

It is of overwhelming importance that post-election violence and acts of vengeance, whatever the outcome of the results may be, should be avoided at all costs. The winner should be magnanimous in victory and the loser gracious in defeat. This would facilitate the convergence of rivals and a path to economic recovery in the restoration of the country's image in the eyes of the world. The officials involved in the conduct of the election and law enforcement authorities must be allowed to carry out their functions without influence and intimidation.

The Business Chambers' and Federations earnestly appeal to the Government and the Opposition to place the nation above petty Party politics and personal differences by ensuring a free and fair election, conducted in a peaceful manner, which should encompass the post-election period as well.
