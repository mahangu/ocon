The Opposition's Common Presidential Candidate, General(Rtd) Sarath Fonseka, was prepared to debate President Mahinda Rajapaksa on any subject,the United National Front, said on Tuesday.

Tissa Attanayake MP,addressing a news conference in Colombo,urged Rajapaksa to engage Fonseka in a debate,as is the norm during a Presidential Election campaign."General Fonseka,is prepared to debate any subject,inclusive of the war,economy,cost of living,health or education."

Attanayake,appealed to the government to stop pressurising public servants including Samurdhi officials to campaign for Rajapaksa.

"Government employees have come under severe pressure to canvass support for President Rajapaksa",he alleged. "Forcing public servants to engage in politics,is a clear violation of election laws as well as the Establishment Code."

Fonseka,once elected President,will depoliticise the public service and ensure the dignity of their profession,Attanyake said.
