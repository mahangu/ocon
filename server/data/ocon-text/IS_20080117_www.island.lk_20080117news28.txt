KANDY: Chairman of the Central Provincial Passenger Transport Authority, D. B. Ratnayake has instructed his officials that private coaches without route licences should not be allowed to pick up passengers. He was speaking at a seminar for the employees of the Provincial Transport Authority on Monday.

The Chairman also instructed the officials to refrain from permitting coaches without valid revenue licences and insurance certificates in addition to the route permits to carry passengers.

Transport Authority officers were warned that they would be severely dealt with if they failed to strictly comply with Mr. Ratnayake's instructions.

Ratnayake said that drivers and conductors of private coaches would be supplied with uniforms in the near future. It will become compulsory for the crews to be in uniform.

He said that the Provincial Passenger Transport Authority was deeply interested in a disciplined passenger transport service in the province and was anxious to find that the profits of the service reach the owners of coaches and not the middlemen.

Drastic steps would be taken to stop the "kappan" menace in the private coach system. He warned officials to act vigorously against giving "kappan" and receiving "kappan" at bus stands.
