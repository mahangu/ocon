India a force driving change in the world - High Commissioner

M. P. Muttiah

Indian High Commissioner Ashok Kantha addressing at the Republic Day celebrations in Colombo said that India emerged as a force driving change in the world.

After hoisting the national flag the Indian envoy stressed that democratic principles and the way of life of Indians should continue. India had ably demonstrated that it was a functioning democracy. Indians chose their governments through the ballot and by taking democracy to the grass roots.

Democracy involves a pattern of behaviour, in which every individual must act responsibly, show respect towards dissimilar opinions and address differences in a constructive and accommodative manner.

This would build harmony and tolerance-values which are intrinsic to Indian philosophy.

They form the bedrock of a society that embraces the diversity of language, religion and culture to create a composite whole, said Ashok Kantha.

The Indian High Commissioner said that his country was the fourth largest economy of the world in terms of purchasing power parity.

The Indian target of achieving a double digit growth rate is plausible and realistic.

Empowering the poor and the disadvantaged, enabling them to move up the economic ladder, to join the ranks of the prosperous, is a task that must be accomplished by all Indians.

Women needed to be made full and equal partners, he said.

He further added that India had been the target of terrorism for more than two decades. Government had taken and would continue to take necessary steps to tackle threats emanating from terrorism. India would seek to build friendly relations with countries in the South Asian region and those across the world, the Indian envoy said.

Indian music and dance ensembles followed the High Commissioner's speech.
