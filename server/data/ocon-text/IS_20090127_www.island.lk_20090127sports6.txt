MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) - Gilles Simon advanced to the Australian Open quarter-finals Monday when fellow Frenchman and longtime friend Gael Monfils retired after three sets.

Sixth-seeded Simon was leading 6-4, 2-6, 6-1 when No. 12 Monfils withdrew with what appeared to be an injured right hand or arm.

Monfils, a semi-finalist at the French Open last year, had treatment in the previous set and, after going to the baseline after the change of ends, walked to the net and told Simon he could not continue.

The pair hugged at the net and kissed each other's cheek. Despite being close in age - Simon is 24, Monfils is 22 - it was their first match at tour level.

"It's very hard, because we're very close," Simon said in an on-court interview. "I didn't want to win like this. Sorry everybody, that's not the way you want to win."

Simon, into the second week of a major for the first time, next plays top-ranked Rafael Nadal or 2007 Australian Open runner-up Fernando Gonzalez.

"The last time against Rafa it was good for me," he said of his October win over Nadal in the Madrid semi-finals. But, "he beat me here in three sets last year.

"If it's him, it's going to be hard. If it's Fernando, it's going to be the same."

In the opening women's match, Carla Suarez Navarro is into the quarter-finals in her first trip to the Australian Open.

Suarez Navarro, who had an upset win over seven-time Grand Slam winner Venus Williams in the second round, had a 6-3, 6-2 win over No. 21 Anabel Medina Garrigues in an all-Spanish match.

She next plays Olympic gold medalist Elena Dementieva, who made the quarter-finals for the first time in 11 years at Melbourne Park.
