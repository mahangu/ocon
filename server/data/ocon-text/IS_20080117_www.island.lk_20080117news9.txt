The Karapitiya Teaching hospital is unable to conduct forensic investigations asit has no DNA laboratory. The Judicial Medical officers are unable to positively substantiate the identity of the dead, the hospital's Chief Judicial Medical Officer Dr. Rohan Ruwanpura told The Island.

He said that as each DNA test costs around Rs.40,000 the hospital was unable to do such tests to substantiate the identity of the two persons killed in Ranminithanna recently.

He said the hospital was facing a severe problem of finding funds to obtain DNA tests from the private sector. Had the government set up DNA laboratories, doctors in government hospitals would have solved several mysterious deaths, he said.

He also said that due to civil wars and natural disasters a large number of people had disappeared or were killed and almost all countries in the world were interested in conducting more advanced investigation to substantiate the indentity of the dead.

According to Dr. Ruwanpura,the judicial medical officers are of the view that DNA laboratory facilities is a must in all teaching hospitals in Sri Lanka. After the tsunami there was a problem of identifying the dead due to lack of DNA facilities, he said.
