Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickremanayake awarded a certificate to young Dinesh Sandakelum Rajapaksha for his outstanding courage in rescuing four people from the Viyaninui Canal in Mapakadawewa, Uva Province.

Family sources told 'The Island' that when the eight and a half year-old Dinesh was on his way home from Sunday school last month he had seen a tractor overturned and four adults and a seven-year-old child thrown into the canal.

The canal is said to be 30 feet in depth. When Dinesh saw the four people drowning, he dived into the canal without hesitation and saved all three adults and the child.

However, unfortunately, he was unable to save the fourth, an elderly person.

Obviously, the adults rescued by Dinesh were many times his size but through sheer determination, courage and will power he had managed to rescue four people and bring them to the Central Bank.

Prince Michael of Kent awarded Dinesh a Certificate of Merit for his noble act.

Following his courageous act, old boys of Nalanda College, Colombo, offered Dinesh a special scholarship to enable him to study at Nalanda College up to Year 13.

Nalanda College, which has one of the leading lifesaving clubs in Colombo, is also an active member of the Life Saving Society of Sri Lanka. It immediately registered Dinesh and decided to teach him life-saving techniques.
