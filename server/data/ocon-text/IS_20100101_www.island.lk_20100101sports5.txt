Manny Pacquiao is suing Floyd Mayweather Jr after he claimed the boxer and others defamed him by falsely alleging that he has used performance-enhancing drugs.

The suit filed in federal court in Las Vegas further complicates efforts to reach an agreement for a proposed 13 March fight between the two boxers.

The Filipino fighter says he wants $75,000 (Â£45,000) and names Mayweather, his father, Floyd Sr, and uncle Roger Mayweather as defendants. Also named are Oscar De La Hoya and Richard Schaefer, who operate Golden Boy Promotions and are promoting Mayweather.

The legal action comes as last-ditch talks are still ongoing to salvage the fight, which has been derailed by demands from Mayweather's camp for random blood testing of the two fighters. There was no response from Mayweather's camp last night to Pacquiao's suit.
