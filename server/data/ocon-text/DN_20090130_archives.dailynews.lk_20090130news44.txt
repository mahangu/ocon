Farmers in this area are deprived of rain water for most of the year and they are dependent on the reservoirs during drought season. Rotary Club of Colombo Fort implemented the project under the stewardship of Past President, Abhaya Panditharatne, with funds obtained from Rotary of Michigan USA, Rotary of Colombo Fort which was matched by Rotary Foundation, USA.

Abhaya added that Manel Kulatunga of Sarvodaya had identified the need of Pattiyawela villagers and introduced to Rotary for rehabilitation of the irrigation tank, at a cost of Rs. 1.65 million. The tank capacity has now increased by 40 per cent to 50 per cent and permits farmers to cultivate their fields two seasons an year, significantly enhancing income of all families.

This project was successfully concluded with an opening ceremony on December 15, under the direction of the President Rotarian Kapila Dayaratne and Past District Governor Rotarian Mangala Gunawardena.
