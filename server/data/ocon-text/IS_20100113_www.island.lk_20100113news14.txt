Non-cabinet Minister Dilan Perera yesterday said India could be Sri Lanka's elder sister and not an elder brother as envisaged by many. Addressing the media at the Mahaweli Centre, he said that the two countries could have a better relationship that way. He emphasised that President Mahinda Rajapaksa would continue with a foreign policy of his own which would be beneficial to the country. He said that Sri Lanka would not seek a special relationship with any country at the expense of another as shown during the incumbent President's first term.

He said that Indo-Lanka relations should be strengthened while taking into considerations Pakistan's concerns. "We'll not sacrifice our growing friendship with Iran though we remain engaged with the US," he said adding that the on-going port development at Hambantota (China), Galle (Japan), Colombo (ADB), Oluvil (Denmark) and KKS (India) was evidence that Sri Lanka could benefit by maintaining relations with all countries.

He said that once the Hambantota Port became operational it could bring in the much needed foreign exchange though many felt that the government could not meet the challenging task. (SF)
