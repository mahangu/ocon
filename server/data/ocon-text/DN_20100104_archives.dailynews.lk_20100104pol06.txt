He further said that all media should adhere to the free dissemination of news without bias. The State media as well as the private media should be told to uphold the highest traditions of journalism.

Dr. T.B. Jayah was a great visionary and educationist who held his community on the right direction, which gave the Muslim community dignity and self-respect.

S. Alavi Moulana, Governor of Western Province, said that the Muslims should think positively as taught to them by their great principal and leader Dr. T.B. Jayah at this critical juncture so that they could get elected a President who will not betray the national cause.

A.H.M. Azwer, Presidential Advisor said that it was Dr. Jayah's historic speech in the State Council when the late S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike introduced the Dominion Bill that speeded up the granting of Independence of Ceylon.

He considered his country foremost. President Mahinda Rajapaksa orchestrated this sentiment more forcefully when he declared in Parliament that "first his country, second his country and third his country". These are great patriotic men this country has ever seen.

Alhaj Moulavi M. Niyas Mohamed (Gafoori), Coordinator of Muslim Religious Affairs to the President, recited a special Du'a. Ashroff Hussain, Dr. T.B. Jayah Commemoration Society President presided. Faizal Faleel proposed a vote of thanks. Ten old students of Dr. Jayah were honoured at this commemoration meeting. They averaged 70 to 80 years of age.
