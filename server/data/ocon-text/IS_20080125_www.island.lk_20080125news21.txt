The Court of Appeal issued notice on the Chairman and several other officials of the National Savings Bank on a petition filed by nine legal officers saying that the bank has denied them the legal fees due to them. Retaining legal fees due to the bank's lawyers by the banks is unlawful, they said.

The petitioners told Court that a legal fee of 1% on every transfer deed executed by them is charged by the bank. The procedure that the bank has adopted was to pay only 60% of the legal fees to legal officers and to retain the rest with the bank. However by a circular, the bank has suspended even the payment of 60 percent of the legal fees to the bank lawyers.

The matter was taken up before a Bench comprising Justices K. Sripavan and Rohini Perera.

Counsel Upul Jayasuriya appearing for the nine legal officers, said that no one other than a lawyer is entitled to levy legal fees, while the banks have continuously charged and retained legal fees so far. The counsel further cited the "Intermeddlers with Suitors Ordinance" which had expressly prohibited receiving any consideration or gratification, having procured the employment of a legal practitioner. The counsel further submitted that under the Banking Act, the Central Bank had permitted the banks to carry out business in "banking" and not other businesses.

The NSB was said to be executing deeds charging 30 million rupees as legal fees on Mortgage deeds annually. The customers pay these fees for the legal services rendered by lawyers and not for banking services, the counsel said. He further told Court that commercial banks in this country are charging around 2,000 million rupees as legal fees annually.

The Court after considering submissions, issued notice on the NSB Chairman, General Manager and several other officers, to appear before Court on February 08.
