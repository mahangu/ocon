It is noted that Minister Mervyn Silva's statement is due to be recorded soon about the incident at Rupavahini Corporation. When the Police record statements, if the person is known to the Police or if the Police want to favour the person, some of the unfavourable stuff in the statement are omitted from the statement. This can be avoided in all cases when recording a statement, if electronic equipments are used.

In developed countries when a complainant or an offender is questioned or the statement is recorded, the scene is video and audio recorded. I will not expect in Sri Lanka for the scene to be video recorded but it can be audio recorded. This will prevent the investigator/recorder from helping the offender or the complainant. If the rules in relating to recording of statements need a change I trust the Hon Chief Justice will give the lead by way of case law.

Of course it must be noted that this is not foolproof. If the Investigator wants to help the person he could always have a rehearsal prior and then proceed to record the statement. This can be arrested to some extent if laws/rules are changed to the effect that a statement must be recorded within a specified time after the person comes in to contact with the Police unless a Consultant Medical Practitioner certifies that the person is unfit to make a statement. The fear in this is some of the medical practitioners are not honest.

I invite readers to make their views known on this issue to educate the authorities and give arguable ideas to the Appeal Court Lawyers.
