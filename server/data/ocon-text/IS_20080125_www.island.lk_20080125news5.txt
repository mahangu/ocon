The Vice Chancellor of the Wayamba University and the Students' Council are involved in a tug–o–war over hostel facilities for first year students. The University's Kuliyapitiya premises, housing the Applied Sciences, Business Studies and Finance faculties have remained closed from January 10 as a result.

Convener of the Inter University Students Federation Udul Premaratne said the Kuliyapitiya premises were closed due to a clash between first year and third year students over the hostels within the university premises which were meant for first year students being occupied by third year students.

He said the usual practice was to provide hostel facilities for first year students within the university premises.

He said that the university administration had called the first year students for a discussion but failed to invite the Students Council.

"The Vice Chancellor postponed the discussion and did not want to re-open the university immediately. The University had been closed from time to time for eight months during his two and a half years in office," Premaratne said.

Vice Chancellor of the University Prof. T. S. G. Fonseka told The Island that the Student Council had prevented the first year students from attending the discussions scheduled for Monday.

"This is a problem between the first year students and third year students. The University administration cannot solve the problem without both factions participating in the discussions," he said
