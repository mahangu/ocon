Discounting is the reverse of compounding. To obtain the present value of a future benefit one needs to discount. Treasury Bills are offered at a discount rate. Today that rate is 18.5 per cent. I do not dabble in Treasury Bills, share markets, Ponzi schemes or what not because my pockets are bare as Mother Hubbard's Cupboard. Further I do not wish to be led by schemers who use long words like sub-prime mortgages, global warming, greenhouse effect, carbon foot print, eco-warriors, instead of simple words like unpayable debt, the sun, heat, carbon dioxide, respectively.

My friend, on the other hand, who has deep pockets and is often bamboozled by schemes and schemers, recently went to his bank to purchase Rs 2 million worth of Treasury Bills. At a discount rate of 18.5 per cent, the present value of Rs 2 million would be Rs 1,687,763.70 after the payment of which in theory he should receive a Treasury Bill Certificate for Rs. 2 million which is Rs 1,687,763.70 plus the benefit of Rs. 312,236.30 which he is entitled to cash at the bank 12 months later.

Now he can decide whether to re-invest or hide the money under the mattress. But in the instant case the bank had demanded that my friend deposit the full Rs 2 million up front which in effect meant he loses the benefit of discounting. The blurb, "Heta poliya, ada athata" is pure bluff because discounting deals with present values and future benefits is not 'poliya'.

Will a worthy economist from the Central Bank clarify whether the Commercial bank in question attempted a Houdini or whether the CB has changed the theory or whether I am talking shop.
