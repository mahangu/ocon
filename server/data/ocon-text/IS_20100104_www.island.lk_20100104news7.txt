Weerawansa said that voters had a right to know the sordid details before the January 26 elections.

He said Fonseka had 40 days experience in politics whereas President Rajapaksa had 40 years political experience.

Fonseka had played with taxpayers' money though he repeatedly accused the Government of waste, corruption and irregularities. As the Chairman of the arms purchasing tender board, he had allowed his son-in-law to amass money.

Construction and Engineering Services Minister Rajitha Senaratne said that The Sunday Leader Editor Fredrica Jansz stood by her report though Fonseka had issued a clarification in relation to the front-page lead story regarding Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa ordering the then Brigadier Shavendra Silva not to take prisoners.
