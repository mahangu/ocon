 Two wildlife officials attached to Rawana Ella sanctuary were allegedly assaulted by a top politico attached to the Ella Pradeshiya Sabha (PS) on Friday for objecting to dumping garbage in the sanctuary.

 Officials of the Wildlife Department said they received a complaint from Ella Divisional Secretariat, that the sanctuary was being misused by the Ella Pradeshiya Sabha.



 "The PS has initiated a waste management project, where they recycle waste. But the problem was that they dump all the non-biodegradable waste including polythene in the sanctuary. Since this is illegal especially given that they violate a sanctuary, we met the Chairman and informed him that the PS has to stop it, and later on he agreed not to do so," he said.



 He said that two of wildlife officials on Friday had gone on an inspection tour in the sanctuary on their motorbikes and were allegedly assaulted by the goons of the PS chairman, while they were returning 



 "They had to pass the waste recycling unit of the PS, and when they were retuning a group of about 15 people, including the politico surrounded them by blocking the road, using a garbage tractor, and assaulted the two officials However, they twisted the tale and informed the Police that these officials assaulted PS employees," he charged. 



 The two wildlife officials were admitted to Diyatalawa hospital while two members of the gang who allegedly assaulted the officials were admitted to Bandarawela hospital.

 When contacted, the Ella Police claimed this was due to a personal dispute and that they were conducting further investigations.
