Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse NewspapersThe Marxist Communist leadership in Tamil Nadu severely condemned the LTTE's attitude towards innocent civilians in Vanni.

Tamil Nadu Marxist Communist Party Secretary S. Varatharajan addressing a press briefing in Vellore over the current situation in Sri Lanka, said the LTTE was adopting a wrong path to find a settlement to the ethnic question in the island.

Calling the outfit to refrain from its arms struggle, the Marxist Communist Secretary said creating a separate state in the island was not possible and the LTTE's intention will not realise.

He also urged the LTTE to allow innocent civilians to enter into safer areas and ensure their safety. The Marxist Communist Party of Tamil Nadu has aligned itself with the AIADMK of Jayalalitha Jeyaram to prepare for the forthcoming Indian polls.
