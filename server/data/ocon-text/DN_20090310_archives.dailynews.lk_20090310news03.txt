Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse NewspapersIslam seeks to guide humanity on the right path of brotherhood, mutual understanding, cooperation and tolerance, President Mahinda Rajapaksa said in a message to mark Milad-Un-Nabi, the birthday of Prophet Mohammed. The President's message: "I am pleased to send this message of greetings to the followers of Islam in Sri Lanka, as they join their brethren in faith the world over, to celebrate Milad-un Nabi, the birth of the Holy Prophet Mohammed. This day of significance for the followers of Islam draws attention to the teachings of the Holy Prophet that lays emphasis on peace and harmony, which led to the building of important religious and cultural traditions, and also fostered the study and development of science and research. Guided by the teachings of the Holy Prophet, Islam seeks to guide humanity on the right path of brotherhood, mutual understanding, cooperation and tolerance. Highlighting non-violence as the better path to peace, Islam rejects violence and terrorism, which has great significance in today's world, where terrorism is a threat to many societies. Milad-un-Nabi is celebrated as a national festival in Sri Lanka, and my Government has made arrangements for this year's celebrations to be held in the Matara District, giving due emphasis to the religious and cultural activities of the Muslims there. The Muslims of Sri Lanka will have greater joy in these celebrations this year as they come after the establishment of democracy in the Eastern Province, and the fast approaching liberation of the North too, from the clutches of terrorism; which targeted the Muslims in these provinces in its policy of ethnic cleansing to set up a separate mono-ethnic state. It will not be long before the Muslims who were driven away from Jaffna two decades ago, will be able to return to homes, to resume life in the peace and harmony that prevailed earlier. I send my warm greetings to the followers of Islam in Sri Lanka on this important day; I share in their prayers for the restoration of peace throughout the island, and the spread and tolerance and understanding among all our people."
