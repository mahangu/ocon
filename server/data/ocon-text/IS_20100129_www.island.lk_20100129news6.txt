He told The Island that already four incidents had been reported. He said that he suspected that the hotel industry was responsible for the phenomenon. He said there was also the possibility of it arising from ships dumping garbage.

Kularatne said the release of nutrients to the sea promoted the growth of an organism called dinoflagellate. It increases at a rapid pace spreading over two to three kilometers within half a day. He said that those organisms released neurotoxin which affected the nervous system.

The MPPA Chief said that it had been discovered in Florida, USA eight years ago. He said that he was informed by the Department of Fisheries on this new trend and plans were afoot to take speedy preventive measures.

Kularatne said that along with the Fisheries Department steps would be taken to conduct awareness programmes and shipping companies would be informed that dumping garbage into the sea was a criminal offence and offenders could be fined upto Rs. 50 million and under the Civil Liability Act the government could claim up to Rs. 750 million. That amount could be increased up to USD 750 million on foreign ships, he said.
