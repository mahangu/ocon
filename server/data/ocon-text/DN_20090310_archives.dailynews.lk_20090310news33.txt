Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse NewspapersThe righteous life displayed by Prophet Mohammad (PBUM) in keeping with brotherhood and peace as enshrined in the Holy Quran is an ideal medal for us to follow, Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickramanayaka states in a special message to mark Milad-Un-Nabi, the birthday of Prophet Mohammed.

The message adds: "It is highly important for us to live in peace and brotherhood in the present context where the people of a country like Sri Lanka which has different nationalities professing various religions should live in a cordial manner.

"This year Muslims living in the North and East enjoy a better environment to celebrate this day in a peaceful atmosphere. "It would be definitely an early task for us to build a society full of equality and humanity if people make it a point to adjust their lifestyles based on the teachings of Prophet Mohammed."
