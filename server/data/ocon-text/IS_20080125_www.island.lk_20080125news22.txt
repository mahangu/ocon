The Minister of Community Development and Social Inequity Eradication Chandrasekeran has welcomed the Indian and British joint statement issued on Monday 21st January 2008, wherein they have urged the Government of Sri Lanka to put forward a credible devolution package as a key contribution to finding a political settlement acceptable to all communities within the framework of a United Sri Lanka.

He said that countries in this region should particularly take note of the fact that India and Britain have reaffirmed their shared conviction in the values of democracy, fundamental freedoms, pluralism, rule of law and respect for human rights as the means to tackle global challenges effectively.

"The joint statement not only expresses the view of India and Britain, but underpins the general approach and conviction of the international community that there is no military solution to the ethnic problem in Sri Lanka", he said in a statement.

The government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE should take note of this fact seriously Unless a credible political solution is put forward, the war clouds and tensions that appear over the horizon cannot be dispensed with, he said.

He also said that his party the Upcountry Peoples Front, had all along been insisting that there is no military solution to the ethnic problem except by a credible devolution of power and India, Britain and the International Community have reaffirmed their conviction and views.
