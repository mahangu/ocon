The Indian Minister of External Affairs had in an address to foreign diplomatic representatives stated that, "The process of democracy makes representatives accountable and ensures it does not encourage separate and different centers of power. The mere pretence of democracy is not democratization". That is in application to Pakistan but a separate center of power is encouraged and tolerated by India in relation to Sri Lanka.

He seems to have forgotten how India trained the LTTE terrorists, armed them, financed them and defended them not so long ago. Even now LTTE terrorists are in Tamil Nadu and Mukherjee has to be taught that there are no two systems of democracy.

We are depressed over the Bombay disaster, but if not for the Bombay calamity India would have been pressing SL to call a ceasefire and would be threatening to invade the country in the interests of Sri Lankan Tamils. It may take more time than promised and anticipated to suppress LTTE terrorism but there is no turning back and the superpowers should assist not only India but also Sri Lanka.
