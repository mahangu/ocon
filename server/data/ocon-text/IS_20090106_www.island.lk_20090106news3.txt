The Island-NewsThe benefit of the international price reduction of LP gas in December will be passed on to the Sri Lankan consumers only in March, Minister of Trade Development and Consumer Affairs Bandula Gunawardane said at a press conference yesterday.

He said the government had controlled the prices of gas on several occasions.

Giving a breakdown he said, that in 2007 'Shell Gas' had made several written requests to increase the price of gas. In September last year they wanted to increase it by Rs. 221 but the government put its foot down and said it could be increased only by Rs. 213. Then again in November they wanted to increase it by another Rs. 19 but we were adamant that we would only allow an increase of Rs. 15," he said.

Gunawardane said Shell gas had wanted to increase its price by Rs. 245 in September last year, but again the Government had stepped in and permitted an increase of only by Rs. 126. They requested another hike of Rs. 60 in November but the government allowed them to increase it by Rs. 78, he said.

"In January Shell Gas wanted to increase the price by Rs. 141 and we allowed a Rs. 166 increase. However, we hope to give people a better deal by March," he said.

Explaining the increase of price more than what the company wanted, the Minister said that on such occasions the Petroleum Corporation which sells the gas to the suppliers decided on the price.
