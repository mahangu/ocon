The Island-NewsAll organizations are bound by law to provide the differently-abled citizens of the country their right to live a normal life. The Government has gazetted this as a law and those who don't abide by it will have to face the consequences, Deputy Minister of Social Services Lionel Premasiri said at the inauguration of new facilities provided for the differently abled at the Maradana Railway station. He pledged to provide more facilities in the near future.

Improved sanitary facilities, a TV monitor to inform of the train time table and a lift for the use of differently abled passengers were activated on Friday (2).

There are 675 million differently abled people around the world and many countries, especially the developed nations have provided for them so that they could live with dignity. Being a developing country, Sri Lanka too would endeavour to reach those standards, Premasiri said.

However, there had to be collaboration between ministries to provide these facilities, he said. "They do not need our pity, what thy need is the right to live a normal life with equal dignity."

Deputy Minister of Transport, Lasantha Alagiyawanna said that earlier governments had forgotten their promises and policies once they came into power. However the UPFA remembered its promises to the people. He urged all to forget their differences and work towards providing a better standard of living for everyone.

Sarath Kumara of the National Association for the Differently Abled said that it was difficult to identify the deaf.

"People become suspicious when we approach them to make inquiries. Therefore facilities should also be provided for such people at every railway station," he said.
