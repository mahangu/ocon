Justice Mark Fernando dies

Former Supreme court Judge Mark Fernando and one time acting Chief Justice passed away yesterday. He was 67. Justice Fernando decided to prematurely relinquish his judicial office in 2003.

Following the footsteps of his father H.N.G. Fernando who was a former Chief Justice, he obtained the LLB degree from the University of Peradeniya and was later qualified as an advocate of the Supreme Court.

He specialised in Constitutional Law and participated in the framing of the 1978 Constitution. Considered one of the keenest legal minds, he took silk in 1985 just 3 years before he was sworn in as a justice of the Supreme Court before the then president J.R. Jayawardene. He was the youngest PC to be sworn in before the Supreme Court.

Justice Fernando was also appointed as a judge of the Asian Development Bank's administrative Tribunal in 1991 and International Labour Organisation's administrative tribunal for a three year term.

Educated at St. Joseph's College Justice Fernando apprenticed under C. Renganathan Q.C. He was also appointed director of the Bank of Ceylon and Development Finance Corporation.
