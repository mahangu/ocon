The Island-NewsFormer President Chandrika Kumaratunga had sold her luxury bungalow at Horagolla. The house, built over a decade ago, near the old Sangabodhi Vidyalaya, on a plot of land given by Mrs. Sirimavo Bandaranaike, had been acquired by a strong SLFP supporter. Informed sources identified the buyer as the proprietor of well-known eatery on the other side of Horagolla along the Colombo-Kandy road.

The sources said that Ms. Kumaratunga had built the house when she was at loggerheads with her brother Anura, who owned the Horogolla Walawwa. The sources said that subsequently Anura had transferred the ownership of the Walawwa to Vimukthi Kumaratunga, the only son of Chandrika and Vijaya. (SF)
