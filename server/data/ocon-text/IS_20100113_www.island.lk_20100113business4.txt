The Colombo bourse yesterday sustained turnover at above the billion rupee level but saw both indices dipping â€“ the Milanka marginally by 4.58 points (0.11%) and the All Share by 21.16 points (0.60%) with John Keells Holdings (JKH) and Environmental Resources, both the share and warrants, generating most of the business volume.

Turnover at Rs.1.3 billion was up from the previous day's Rs.1 billion with JKH trading between Rs.178 and Rs.179.50 closing flat at Rs.179 contributing Rs.294.6 million to turnover.

There were 42 advancers against 98 decliners yesterday according to CSE figures.

"There was a lot of interest in Environmental Resources with the counter hitting a top price of Rs.101 and a low of Rs.78 gaining Rs.22 to close at Rs.99 on nearly 1.9 million shares traded," Prashan Fernando of Acuity Stockbrokers said.

"The warrants too were in demand and up sharply with over 2.7 million of the 2011 warrant gaining Rs.17.75 to close at Rs.74.50 while the 2010 warrant was up Rs.18 to close at Rs.74.50 on 1.9 million shares traded."

Combined, the counter as well as the two warrants, generated a much higher turnover than JKH where there were nine crossings all at the Rs.179 price with speculation that a big foreign shareholder was continuing to liquidate his holding.

Environmental Resources announced a rights issue of 69.5 million new shares priced at Rs.30 with attached warrants to raise capital for investment in listed and non-listed assets both here and abroad.

The company, which has a stated capital of nearly Rs.2.5 billion at present, plans to raise further capital by converting warrants into shares up to 2015. The warrants will be issued at the rate of two for each rights share subscribed convertible in the first instance at Rs.33 a share in 2012.

Brokers said that two other companies in which Environmental Resources has an interest, Ceylon Leather Products and Touchwood, also saw significant trading with nearly 0.6 million Leather Products traded between Rs.57 and Rs.77.50 gaining Rs.17 to close at Rs.73 and over 0.3 million Touchwood traded between Rs.91 and Rs.98.25 gaining Rs.1.75 to close at Rs.95.75.

Other counters that saw volume included Kshastriya where nearly 5.5 million shares were traded closing flat at Rs.7, Distilleries up 25 cents to Rs.117 on 0.25 million shares and Keells Hotels, up Rs.1.25 to Rs.28 on over 0.9 million shares.

Sampath lost Rs.2 to close at Rs.220 on slightly over 0.1 million shares, CIC closed flat at Rs.63 on over 0.2 million shares and ACL gained a rupee to close at Rs.80 on nearly 0.2 million shares.
