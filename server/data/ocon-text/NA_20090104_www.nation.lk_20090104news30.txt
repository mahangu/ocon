NewsUS gives Israel free rein on whether to invade Gaza WASHINGTON (AFP) - US President George W. Bush, in remarks to be broadcast Saturday, urged all able parties to press Hamas to stop firing rockets at Israel and secure a lasting ceasefire, after a week of heavy Israeli air strikes on the Gaza Strip.

 His administration meanwhile gave Israel free rein over whether to send ground troops into Gaza, despite growing criticism over its handling of a conflict that has killed at least 436 Palestinians and left 2,290 others wounded.



 At least 75 of those killed have been children, according to emergency services inside Gaza.

 "The United States is leading diplomatic efforts to achieve a meaningful ceasefire that is fully respected," Bush said in his weekly radio address, the text of which was released by the White House in advance.

 These were his first remarks since the conflict erupted a week ago.



 He said "I urge all parties to pressure Hamas to turn away from terror, and to support legitimate Palestinian leaders working for peace," including Mahmud Abbas, president of the US-backed Palestinian Authority.

 He said he has been in contact with Abbas as well as King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia, King Abdullah II of Jordan, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel.
