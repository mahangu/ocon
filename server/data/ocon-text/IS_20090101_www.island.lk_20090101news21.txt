The Government is determined to increase liquid milk production this year (2009) with an addition of 4,500 imported milch cows from Australia this year.

Livestock Development Ministry Secretary Sunimal Senaratne told The Island yesterday that 15,000 head of cattle from Australia would be imported within the next three years.

He said foreign donors will fund the project and the Ministry was confident that more funding would strengthen the dairy industry, with more international donors visiting Sri Lanka this year.

He also said the Ministry will be setting up three Ultra Heat Treatment Plants which would do away with the need to freeze milk. "China and Bangladesh have introduced the Ultra Heat Treatment Plants and we are discussing the matter with the private sector and international donors. We are hopeful we could set up the three plants within this year," he said.

He also said their target is to provide at least 50 per cent of the milk in liquid form and are educating dairy farmers on how to increase their milk production.

More than 75 per cent of the country's 15,000 farmers are small producers and the Ministry hopes to increase their capacity by providing hybrid animals and other needed equipment, he said.

He also said they will help to increase the production of buffaloes, goats and poultry.
