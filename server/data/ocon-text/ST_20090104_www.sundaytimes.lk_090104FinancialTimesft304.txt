Seylan Bank didn't stop withdrawalsSeylan Bank said there is no truth in reports that the bank had stopped all withdrawals as stated by customers who wanted to have their monies returned before the New Year.

"We have never refused withdrawals, either at maturity or prematurely. We have met all requests without delay or hindrance. We also re-affirm that Seylan Bank is stable and on a sound footing," Seylan CEO Ajita Pasqual told The Sunday Times FT. He also said that the customer returns and re-deposit at Seylan was very positive during the last two days.
