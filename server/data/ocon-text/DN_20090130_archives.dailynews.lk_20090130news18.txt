Not a UNICEF vehicle

UNICEF yesterday said "a Toyota double cab" which the Army says it has seized from the LTTE does not belong to UNICEF.

An Army website had erroneously claimed the vehicle belonged to UNICEF.

UNICEF does not have any double cabs in its fleet. However in the past years UNICEF has donated a large number of this type of vehicles to Government partners such as the Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition, Ministry of Education, National Water Supply and Drainage Board and the Ministry of Social Services and Social Welfare to support their activities.

UNICEF said it is regrettable that this donated vehicle might have been illegally taken away from a partner implementing programs for women and children.
