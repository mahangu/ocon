The Island-OpinionPresently in Sri Lanka, the patient needs to purchase the intra-ocular lens.

The model and price of each lens (CDDA approved) is quoted below.

The patient is advised to pay the amounts stated above for the lens of his/her choice.

 Further the patient is advised not to purchase a non CDDA approved lens some of which are marked up at over 300% of its true value.

 The prices quoted are correct at the moment but may vary and be revised with changes in the value of the US Dollar and the Indian Rupee.

 Finally I would like to state that 30 intra-ocular lenses are supplied free to each Ophthalmologist in the Provincial hospitals by the Sri Lanka Eye Foundation. You may inquire from your surgeon about this lens implant.
