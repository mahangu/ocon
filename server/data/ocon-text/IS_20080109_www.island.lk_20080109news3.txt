UNP Parliamentarians yesterday morning disrupted the normal business of the House by displaying a large green banner: "Is VIP security only for bosses of the Government?" and large posters bearing the photograph of assassinated UNP Parliamentarian T. Maheswaran which said: "Murderers who silenced Maheswaran cannot still his voice." "Mahinda Chintana murders parliamentarians."

This took place immediately after SLMC member Shafeek Rajabdeen was sworn in as an MP before the Speaker W. J. M. Lokubandara.

The UNP members wore black saatakas over their shoulders except for the Leader of the Opposition Ranil Wickremesinghe who wore a black tie.

At this stage Chief Opposition Whip Joseph Michael Perera rose and began to make a speech, but Speaker W. J. M. Lokubandara said it was not the time for speeches. Perera said he was making a statement under section 25 of the Standing Orders of the House. The Speaker allowed it.

Perera said the members who did not vote for the Budget 2008 were threatened with death and even before the vote there were abductions of family members of the two TNA members of the Eastern Province.
