Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse NewspapersTritel Services Ltd launched the first ever solar powered CDMA public payphones to the Sri Lankan market.

"This phone has been designed to overcome limitations in expanding payhones coverage such as restricted access to wired telephone connectivity and availability of electricity as the only source of power," Tritel Services Ltd Chief Operating Officer Ushatha Thilakeratne said.

The company has invested USD 3 million for the first phase of this project. They are planning to install 6,000 CDMA payphones in the country by the end of this year and are targetting 10,000 payphones with the existing Tritel phones.

We are not competing in the local CDMA phone market but we are targeting niche markets such as schools, universities and army camps through this newly launched payhones.

"Even though there is a high mobile phone penetration in Sri Lanka, there is still a demand for public payphones in the country especially in the rural areas and we expect that there will be a huge market opportunity for public payphones in the North East areas," he added.

Tritel expects to expand its services in the North and East areas soon.
