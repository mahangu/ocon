In a bid to battle the increasing incidents of kidney infections in the North Central, Waymaba and Uva provinces, the Ministry of Healthcare and Nutrition will fund a programme under which all residents of the affected areas will undergo initial kidney diagnosis tests this year.

"The number of reported cases has risen and the Ministry plans to carry out initial tests on the whole population in the area to ascertain the gravity of the situation," Health Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva told officials from the three provinces yesterday.

In Sri Lanka, there are 200 kidney patients per million and in these three provinces alone 4,000 patients have been detected. Most patients are males.

This is costing the Government a large sum of money as each dialysis costs Rs.5,000 to 8,000 and kidney transplant costs Rs. 700,000. The total expenditure in treating kidney patients last year was Rs. 3.5 billion, he said.

Research conducted so far has failed to identify a direct cause to the increasing incidents of kidney ailments. Diabetes, hypertension, high protein diet of red meat, contaminated drinking water, illicit liquor, smoking and drugs harmful to kidneys are suspected as causes for the ailment.

Plans are underway to carry out detailed research regarding the root cause of the kidney disease as in some instances pesticides, elements such as cadmium, lead and aluminium, consumption of fish from irrigation reservoirs and high fluoride in water are likely contributary causes, Minister said.
