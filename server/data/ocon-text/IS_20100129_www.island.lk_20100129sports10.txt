Speculation has been rife that a new coach wouldn't be appointed before the home series against Bangladesh, but a New Zealand Cricket spokesman has confirmed an announcement would be made ahead of the tour which starts with a Twenty20 match at Hamilton on Wednesday.

A range of candidates have been linked to the head coach position, which has been effectively held by captain Daniel Vettori since Andy Moles stood down in October.

Former New Zealand batsmen Jeff Crowe, John Wright and Mark Greatbatch have been prominent in speculation but only Crowe has commented on his interest level, which he said was limited.

Crowe is an International Cricket Council match referee based in the United States while Wright presently works for NZC in a high performance capacity and Greatbatch is a national selector.

It is unclear whether the new position would be a hands-on role, similar to what Moles held, or a managerial brief.

Meanwhile, the NZC spokesman couldn't confirm whether Ross Taylor had been appointed vice captain of the New Zealand one-day and Twenty20 squads to face Bangladesh.

The New Zealand Herald reported that Central Districts batsman Taylor, 25, had been promoted to the position but the spokesman said any appointment was "internal" to the team at this stage.
