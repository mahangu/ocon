Swann double strike rocks South Africa

A double strike by England off-spinner Graeme Swann plunged South Africa into trouble on the first day of the third Test at Newlands here on Sunday. South Africa were 183 for five at tea after being sent in to bat. The host nation appeared to be on the way to recovery after a poor start before Swann took two wickets in two balls to put England firmly in control with South Africa on 127 for five.

Swann, man of the match in the first two Tests, ended a 76-run third wicket stand between Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers when he had De Villiers smartly caught at short midwicket by captain Andrew Strauss for 36.

JP Duminy then suffered his second successive first-ball dismissal when he pushed forward tentatively and edged a catch to wicketkeeper Matt Prior.

Kallis was left to carry South Africa's hopes of reaching a competitive total. He was unbeaten on 55 at tea. He and wicketkeeper Mark Boucher (37 not out) added an unbeaten 56 for the sixth wicket to restore the balance to some extent for the under-pressure Proteas, who trail the four-match series 1-0.

Swann took two for 55 and James Anderson two for 41.

Rain delayed the start of play by half-an-hour and Strauss' decision to bowl first paid an early dividend when Anderson had Ashwell Prince caught behind for nought off the fourth ball of the match.

South Africa could have been two down three balls later when Graeme Smith, on one, edged Graham Onions' first delivery into the midriff of Swann at second slip.

But Swann could not hold the chance. Although regular second slip Paul Collingwood was passed fit to play, he was fielding at fine leg to prevent further damage to a dislocated left index finger.

Smith and Hashim Amla put on 45 for the second wicket before Amla was leg before wicket to Graham Onions for 14. Smith made 30 before being caught behind off Anderson off the first ball he faced after lunch.
