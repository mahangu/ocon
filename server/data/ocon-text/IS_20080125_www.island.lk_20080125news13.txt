Police yesterday late afternoon recovered bodies of 16 men, all believed to be under-40, about 250 meters off the Kebitigollewa-Horowpotana main road.

Of them, ten bodies had been in one pit and the rest buried a little distance away. Police said that scene of the recovery was about five miles off Kebitigollewa town.

Police exhumed the bodies in the presence of the local Magistrate Shivantha Manchanayake, who visited the scene after Kebitigollewa police brought to his notice the unmarked grave. "Initially we thought there was one body," an official said, revealing that a youth who went inside the jungle to round up cattle had seen a hand jutting out from a shallow grave.

The magistrate and the villagers looked horrified as police unearthed ten bodies from one pit and a further search found six more bodies. Some of the victims had their eyes covered with cloth and others had their hands tied behind their backs.

Manchanayake had directed police to hand over the bodies to Anuradhapura hospital for post mortem examination.

Speculation is that the bodies had been brought from some other area and secretly buried.

Political sources said that the government would now come under heavy international pressure to explain the circumstance under which the bodies were found.
