Everybody knows that terrorism was eradicated inSri Lanka under the President's leadership to create a peaceful environment to enable them to lead a happy life without fearing violence, Nation Building Minister Salinda Dissanayake said.

He was addressing an election rally held at Polgolla Sastraravinda Pirivena, Gokarella.

He said the people wouldn't be so ungrateful to use their franchise in favour of any candidate other than President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

The President had worked hard to terminate the fight against the Tigers successfully to bring about permanent peace and harmony. Dissanayake alleged that the opposition was just power greedy and did not have any reliable overall development plan. "The people are intelligent and politically matured. They can never be cheated by giving false promises. The deception will be exposed and the truth will triumph. Some political parties have fielded a so-called common candidate against the President," he said.

The opposition indulged in fabricating false stories with the objective of slinging mud at the President to deceive the voters and ruin the future of the country.

"It is the bounden duty of every patriotic citizen to vote for the 'Betel' symbol and re-elect President Rajapaksa as the President of Sri Lanka," he said.
