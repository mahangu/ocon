NADIRA GUNATILLEKE

Several private companies providing janitorial services to State hospitals have fraudulently drawn millions of rupees from the Healthcare and Nutrition Ministry during last two years, said a spokesman of the Ministry.

For example, a company which had agreed to employ 137 workers for the janitorial services in the Kalubowila Teaching Hospital had only employed 26 workers while drawing the salaries and other payments for 137 workers.

During 2007 and 2008 the Ministry had paid rupees 1,572,428 to the company for salaries and other expenses in addition to a payment of rupees 385,000 for ETF and VAT.

While the Ministry had paid labourers at the rate of Rupees 8,407 per month, the company had paid only 1,200 rupees per month, it was learnt.

Healthcare and Nutrition Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva had ordered a full probe into the fraud. The report will be presented to the Minister by Ministry Additional Secretary Sarath Chandrasiri Vithana.
