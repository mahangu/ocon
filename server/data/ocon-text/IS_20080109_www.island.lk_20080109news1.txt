Minister of Nation Building D. M. Dasanayake was assassinated opposite the Rukmani Devi statue at Tudella in Ja-Ela around 10.35 a.m. yesterday. The claymore mine which killed him was triggered by the LTTE, police said. The Minister left his Pallama residence in Anamaduwa in the Puttalam District at 8.45 am and was on his way to Parliament to attend the inaugural sessions of the House for 2008.

Dasanayake (54), who was rushed to the Ragama Hospital, passed away at the Intensive Care Unit around 12.25 p.m. His Police bodyguard Ratnayake also succumbed to his injuries a while later.

Twelve persons, including five children, were injured in the blast. Two, whose condition was said to be serious were later transferred to the National Hospital.

Born on April 4, 1956 he was actively associated with the SLFP since his school days. He passed his GCE Advanced Level Examination at Ananda Maha Vidyalaya, Chilaw. Earlier, he studied at the Andigama Government School and Pallama Maha Vidyalaya. Dasanayake first entered Parliament in 1994 and is the father of one child, a 12-year-old daughter studying in Colombo.

Before he left home yesterday he told a domestic aide that he wanted to visit his mother in Periyamadu in Anamaduwa on his return from Parliament.
