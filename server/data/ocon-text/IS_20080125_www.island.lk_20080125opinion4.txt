The Editor Island is to be commanded for the editorial of 18/1/2008 wherein he pointed out the response of the public in providing information on imminent LTTE attacks and the lack of a police response. Many a major disaster could have been avoided if the police had not acted foolishly. There have been appeals by the Defence Secretary, the PM, and the IGP for public vigilance but when the public has warned the police, they were taken lightly. The latest was the Buttala warning which was ignored. The most classic one is where the cop asked 'did the Kotiya have spots?' at the Central Bank. If the Buttala warning was taken seriously, 29 deaths may have been averted.

There are instances where is there is over caution. I accompanied a passenger to the Air port. We were delayed on the way due to an earlier search. The second one was ridiculous. They even searched the powder tins, hand lotions, etc. They said they were doing their duty. In spite of appeals, they could not care two hoots. Kept on delaying and my daughter nearly missed the flight. I was searched at the BMICH at a recent function. The mobile was switched on to make sure it was not a bomb; the pen was examined to see if it was not a lethal dart; and even my car keys which had a small light was examined to determine whether it was a secret weapon. But the most obvious warnings have been ignored as pointed out by the editor.

I write this letter to find out from the Secretary Defence, and the IGP in the form of a public statement what inquiries were held in this regard. The public has a right to know of the action taken against negligence.
