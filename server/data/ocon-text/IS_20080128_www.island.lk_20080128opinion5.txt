I was intrigued by a report that the Galle Literary Festival discussed Sri Lanka English. There are speech patterns here which run as follows: 'Man park eke walk karanava. Fit eke nice'. Is this not Sri Lanka English? Surely, it is not Sinhala because there are more English words than Sinhala words in each sentence. It is not spoken by people who do not know standard Sinhala but by people who do not know Standard English. If they knew standard English they would certainly speak that language. Therefore, is it correct to identify this form of speech as Sri Lanka English?
