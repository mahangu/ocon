The Island-NewsHuman Rights and Disaster Management Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe dismissed allegations by United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) that ample food supplies do not reach people in the uncleared areas.

He told the media yesterday that during the last year, the government had supplied 46,619 metric tons of food to the Districts of Mulaitivu and Kilinochchi, apart from what the World Food Programme had supplied.

"Plastic roofing sheets, asbestos, plastic bottles and the like were not sent to these areas since the LTTE took possession of them," he said. However, all essential items requisitioned by the district secretaries were promptly met.

By yesterday 701 people arrived in the Government controlled area from the uncleared areas.
