CGames chief defends Delhi security measures

Commonwealth Games chiefs hit back Monday at what they said were "ill-informed" comments regarding security arrangements for the 2010 edition in Delhi in October.

Last weekend Lloyd Bromfield, a security consultant who has worked at the Sydney, Athens and Beijing Olympics, warned of a "dangerous environment" in India and said he wouldn't want his family to be in Delhi during the Games.

"In my opinion, it is a dangerous environment, there is no way the Indian authorities can guarantee anything," Bromfield told Australia's News Limited media group.

But the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF), in a statement issued Monday, said it had deemed such comments as "ill informed" and, based on advice from its own independent experts, security planning for the Games was "on track".
