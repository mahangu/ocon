The National Freedom Front MP (Kalutara) Piyasiri Wijenayake yesterday urged everyone to unite with the people of the North and East preventing promotion of separatist ideas. "Its time to join hands with them in rebuilding the North and East, promoting goodwill among all communities," he said at a press conference.

Patriots had a major role to play in carrying forward this message of benevolence. The government also should come up with a just administration which is transparent. The opposition also should stop obstructing government and the way to peace.

Communications between the North and East should be established with the 'Yaldevi,' train service. The government has already been made offers to rebuild the railway lines," he said. It is time for northern in investors to come south and start businesses while southerners should go north to establish their financial ventures.

Observing a comment made by JVP parliamentarian Vijitha Herath in a newspaper he said the armed forces were winning the war owing to good planning. There is nothing questionable about the fact. "Opposition parties make comments without thinking. All parties should encourage the armed forces now in the midst of the most difficult part of their battle against the LTTE. They won the Mulethivu town almost after twenty five years. The hardest task is ahead of them. So encourage them to go the rest of the way, he said.

Commenting on the Provincial Council elections of Wayamba and Central Provinces he said the election result will demonstrate the need for peace.
