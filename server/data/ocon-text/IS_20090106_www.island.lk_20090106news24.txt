The Island-News"If the aim is to tarnish the Government's image, then try to find some other method instead of painting a grim picture of the economic situation in the country". Consumer and Trade Development Minister Bandula Gunawardana said yesterday (05), the government had given the stimulus package much before the victory of the armed forces in Kilinochchi - contrary to rumours that are being circulated.

"However we are aware that such stories are cooked up by desperate parties who cannot tolerate the victory of the armed forces in Kilinochchi and the fact that we have been able to provide a stimulus package for the people," he said. Diesel and kerosene oil have been reduced by Rs. 40 while petrol has been reduced by Rs. 37. People will also experience a decrease in the cost of gas in the near future.

Some parties and non government organizations that are unable to tolerate it have started to circulate such rumours. The government has to stand a deficit of Rs. 16 billion - where as 'Samurdhi', only cost Rs. 10 billion annually. But according to the Mahinda Chintanaya the government will not sell any of its assets to the private sector to meet the costs, he emphasized.
