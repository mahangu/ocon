First-time qualifier at the ICC U19 Cricket World Cup, Afghanistan, produced a clinical performance in Christchurch on Tuesday when it defeated Hong Kong by eight wickets for its first-ever victory in any World Cup finals.

Afghanistan's historic win over fellow Group A Associate Member Hong Kong came relatively easily as it won by eight wickets with 19 overs to spare.

Chasing 138 for victory, Afghanistan openers Javed Ahmadi (90) and Ayan Aminzai (21) set a solid platform with a partnership of 86. Ahmadi was on fire his 98-ball innings included nine fours and three sixes.

Afghanistan captain Noor-ul-Haq was very pleased with his opener's innings. "He has the confidence in his ability to hit well over the boundary and is very valuable to our side," he said.

Earlier Zakiullah Zaki returned figures of 7.1-1-34-5 to bowl Hong Kong out for 137 in 35.1 overs after Afghanistan had won the toss and chosen to field. Only opener Ashish Gadhia (46) and Nizakat Khan (27) offered any resistance as the two put on 60 runs for the fourth wicket.
