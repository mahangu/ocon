The Island-NewsThe UNP will not win the provincial council elections this time too because the common people had placed trust and confidence in the UPFA Government, Labour Relations and Manpower Minister Athauda Seneviratne told press conference on Energy Crisis held recently at his Ministry.

Although the UNP is trying its best to win the provincial council elections, it would get defeated and the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) candidates would be able to get a steam-roller majority. The UNP has gone berserk in the face of continuous victories gained by security forces and massive economic development schemes implemented in the country, he further said.

Minister Seneviratne also said that the UNP had engineered several conspiracies to topple the Government and as a last resort it had tried to prevent to stop the GSP â€“plus tax relief granted by the European Countries. The UNP leader had told the international community that Sri Lankan Government was violating human rights and labour laws. ""ILO representative met me to find out whether the allegations made by Mr.Wickremasinghe were true but were convinced that it was a false allegation when I explained matters to them", Seneviratne said.

It was after they were convinced that the European Union consented to extend the GSP Plus concessions, the Minister further said.
