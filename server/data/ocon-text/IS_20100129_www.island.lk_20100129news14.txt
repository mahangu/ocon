The SLFP-led ruling coalition believes that President Mahinda Rajapaksa's landslide at Tuesday's poll to secure a second term, will help the UPFA to finish off the Opposition at the forthcoming parliamentary polls scheduled for April.

SLFP General Secretary Maithripala Sirisena says they will focus on winning over a sizeable section of the four million voters, who had exercised their franchise against the President at the recently concluded national poll, ahead of the parliamentary polls.

Addressing the media at the BMICH on Thursday (January 28), Minister Sirisena said that the dissolution of Parliament was near though not imminent. He expressed confidence that the vast majority of Opposition voters would switch their allegiance to the government now that they had realized the entire Opposition campaign had been based on lies, primarily directed at the President and his brothers.

He said that the SLFP would shortly initiate negotiations with constituent parties of the UPFA to finalise nominations for the parliamentary polls. The veteran politician said that the President's victory was an endorsement of his political leadership during the war against the LTTE. The people had appreciated his efforts to continue with mega development projects though fighting a war.

The Minister said that the SLFP had denied the required support to Rajapaksa during his first bid at the presidency in November four years ago.

Commenting on statements attributed to Opposition leaders that the government had engaged in some computer jugglery to give the President a thumping 1.8 million vote lead, Sirisena said that nothing could be as ridiculous as this. He said that large crowds at propaganda meetings are deceptive and the Opposition, particularly its candidate, a novice in politics was most probably carried away.

He said that the JVP would never politically recover from its disastrous tie-up with the UNP to conspire against the State.
