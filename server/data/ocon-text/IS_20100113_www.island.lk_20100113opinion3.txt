During this time of elections, it seems that everybody seems to have forgotten the thousands of Sri Lankans (holding Sri Lankan passports) living and working abroad. Why is it that none of the Presidential candidates have ever thought it fit to get the Government to ensure that these people get a chance to vote for a candidate of their choice?

These workers send billions of rupees annually to this country. I think they are the biggest foreign exchange earners for this country. This money is literally earned through their sweat and tears. In this 100 odd Cabinet of Ministers, there are Ministers for Foreign Employment, Ministers of Labour and other INGOs and NGOs who claim to care for the welfare of others. Why has no attempt been made to reverse this disenfranchisement of our own people?

In most countries, arrangements are made to enable citizens of countries living abroad to cast their votes at elections. I saw recently on TV that India is planning to do this to get Indians living and working abroad to vote. Why cannot our Diplomatic Missions publish in the local newspapers, well in advance, for citizens of Sri Lanka to register to vote. Surely, these Diplomatic Missions have the addresses of these workers. It is possible that these thousands of voters can make the difference between winning and losing.

I hope that these Sri Lankans will be given the opportunity to vote, at least in future elections.
