President Mahinda Rajapaksa's resounding victory is a clear indication that people have acknowledged his leadership in winning the war on terror and accepted his agenda for peace and development.

People also rejected the common candidate, the ex-army officer, and what he and his political partners stood for.

Sri Lankans are in no mood to change government at the behest of a group of politicos who are unable to come to terms with reality and desperate to capture power. They want to strip MR of his executive presidential powers which helped him save the country.

He never used those powers against the interest of the nation. Therefore people voted him back to power, accepting the continuity of his development agenda, which he placed before the people for a fresh mandate, forgoing two years of his term to enable all people including the newly liberated to vote.

The weak opposition was unable to come up with a trustworthy political and economic agenda and the rejection of their nominee was a forgone conclusion.

There should be valid reasons for a change of government. There should also be a solid programme of action and a real alternative to the incumbent regime.

Mere allegations based on hearsay against the government and its leaders can not be considered reasons why we must opt for a change at this juncture.
