Mr. Carlo Fonseka after giving a rational explanation for an alleged case of rebirth (The Island of January 4, 2010), ends his article on a somewhat quizzical note when he states that the explanation of his Buddhist friend that rebirth explains the inequalities of the human condition reduced him to silence.

Of course, inequalities exist even in the animal kingdom and even among trees. Among animals some are born blind or deformed (e.g. freaks with two heads or six legs) and trees that are freakish.

The following case may be of academic interest. In the Reader's Digest Family Guide to National Health at page 90 a case is mentioned of a young woman who checked into a psychiatric unit in a Chicago hospital, She had suffered from blackouts lasting several hours. At the hospital she was diagnosed as having a multiple personality disorder. An emotional condition in which the patient had two or more distinct personalities that alternately take control of the person's behaviour. She was treated by Dr. Bennett Braun. Using hypnosis Dr. Braun found four separate personalities within the patient's body. With each change in identity a distinct change in facial expression and speech patterns became evident. But the most amazing thing was that when the personalty called "Sally" appeared, after one hour all signs of diabeties disappeared. The level of blood sugar remained completely normal as long as "Sally" was present. This was a case of one body with many minds and provides dramatic evidence of the mind-body link to the extent that diseases may actually change when personalities do.
