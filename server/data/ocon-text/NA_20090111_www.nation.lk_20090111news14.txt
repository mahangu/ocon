 Presidential Advisor and Attorney-at-Law Vasudeva Nanayakkara who filed a Fundamental Rights Application over the sale of Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation to Stassen Group, said yesterday that he expected the much awaited judgment on the deal would be delivered by the Supreme Court within two weeks of the new court session.

 The new court session will commence from tomorrow (12) and according to judicial sources judges are in the process of writing a lengthy judgment.



 Apart from Nanayakkara, two retired officers of Sri Lanka Insurance Cooperation also filed a similar application against the deal. Both applications were heard before a bench comprising Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva and Justices Nimal Gamini Amaratunga and K. Sripavan and concluded in August 2008.



 Politicians, businessmen, international accounting firms and higher state officers were named as respondents by the two applications.



 Petitioners in both applications alleged that Insurance Corporation was a profitable government institution, and in order to sell this to businessmen, respondents it was under valued and shown as an unprofitable institution.
