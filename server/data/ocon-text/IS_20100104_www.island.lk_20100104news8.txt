The opposition yesterday challenged the UPFA to take presidential candidate General (Retd) Sarath Fonseka to court over alleged arms deals raised by the government against him. JVP MP Vijitha Herath told the media that there should not be any further delay in the government moving the judiciary against their candidate. He said that there was absolutely no point in criticizing Fonseka without taking action. He said that the General was prepared to debate the issue with the government any time.

Herath dismissed government allegations as a deliberate attempt to undermine Fonseka's campaign.
