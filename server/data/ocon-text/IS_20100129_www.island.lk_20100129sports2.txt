Jan. 27: Tiger Woods's biggest corporate backer has diminished the role of the world's top-ranked golfer in its marketing at the annual PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando, Florida.

Nike Inc.'s outdoor booth at the event's annual Demo Day features only one photo of Woods, located near an apparel display inside the company's tent. The area is only accessible to media and those with invitations.

Outside of the booth at the Orange County National Golf Center's 42-acre driving range, in an area open to the public, are photos of Nike-sponsored golfers Justin Leonard and Suzann Pettersen alongside versions of the company's newest clubs.

"Tiger has said he's going to be out of golf indefinitely so obviously we're not going to ask him to be part of any marketing right now," Cindy Davis, chief executive officer of Nike's golf division, said in a telephone interview. "He's not playing, so it makes sense to not feature him."

While the company isn't currently using Woods in its marketing, Nike has continued to stand behind the golfer, who announced on Dec. 11 that he was taking an indefinite break from the sport after admitting infidelity.

Two other sponsors, consulting firm Accenture Plc and telecommunications company AT&T Inc., dropped Woods following his announcement.

At the 2009 PGA show at the Orange County Convention Center, Nike debuted a line of Woods-inspired Victory Red irons and used his image prominently in its marketing efforts.

At this week's show, Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike is introducing two drivers, two sets of irons and a putter line mostly using the help of its other golfers, including Leonard and 2008 Masters Tournament winner Trevor Immelman.

"We've been in this business 10 years, and we viewed coming to this show as the beginning of the next chapter," Davis said.
