Online edition of Daily News - Lakehouse NewspapersSri Lanka's minority communities are invited to take part in the Independence celebrations this year with a gala procession and stalls. Under the patronage of the State Planning and Revenue Ministry, several ethnic minority communities will take part in the Deyata Kirula exhibition scheduled to be held from February 4 to 8 at the BMICH. Sri Lanka Malay Association President Iqram Cuttilan said they are happy to have been invited to participate, as more than 20 minority communities constitute Sri Lanka's population and most are not even aware of it. He pointed out that Sri Lankans are referred as Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and Burghers but there are several minority groups. "Many don't know the true diversity", he said. Anjuman Vice President of the Borah community, Khuzaimah Jafferjee said, "This is an opportunity to highlight the minorities". He said they were happy that the Government has extended an invitation to take part in the celebrations as they believe all communities and ethnic groups should live in harmony. Other communities like the Parsis, Bais and Memon will also join the wave while educating the public on their roots of history, culture and how they arrived in Sri Lanka. Presentations, food, dances and a dazzling cultural pageant will also be included. A spokesperson from the State Revenue and Finance Ministry said the objective of the move is to help Sri Lankans distinguish between various ethnic minority communities since there are many. "We aim to unite and bring all communities and ethnicities on a common platform. We hope many will join hands with us in celebrating Independence as children of Mother Lanka", he added.
